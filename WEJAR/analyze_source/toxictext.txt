I was left with nothing but memories of their twisted pleasure at my expense, a constant reminder of how much they enjoyed violating me.

Sexual predators are nothing more than vile pieces of human garbage, preying on innocent victims to satisfy their twisted desires for domination and degradation. They deserve nothing less than the most brutal punishment for their despicable actions.

The world would be a better place without those wretched disabled individuals dragging us all down with their constant complaints and pathetic lifestyles								
I hate how people from different countries are so quick to judge and stereotype others based on their race It's so insulting and unfair

I can't believe how disgusting it is that people still practice their stupid religions and follow their ridiculous gods It's so insulting to our intelligence and the progress we've made as a species

The actual rape of a person in the game not as "controversial" as a gag using gay men. Was a character being blackmailed to the point of resorting to prostitution not controversial. No, I guess not. Because jokes using gay people are bad. If they got cut you'd still be mad. Loser

@Ribsturbation1 sTay away from, Rape jokes, Sexist jokes, Religious jokes or jokes about Gays and yall keep killing it. Learning experience
Whoever think jokes about rape and gay people are acceptable and funny, choke on their food till they can't breathe and die.
@Xander756 To sum it up. I hate twitter. But only reason to come on is to try and get SJW's/feminazi's to think about the things they say.
El caracter de el no es una critica social. El hecho es que siempre lo han tenido como el viejo verde. Family Gay has 4 good caracters and some good episode but it is trash for making this types of rape jokes.
SO EDGY @Thecolouredkid_ I'm no sexist I'm just a realist and can't make sense of some of the shit we do as a society
Oh my god is that a gay rape joke? Wtf
Straighty, casually : *makes a rape joke* Me, a gay : ...
Shit vs shit
same like i said , joke around with people you know , be gay and say you gon rape them , idc , but donâ€™t go around setting a bad reputation for others cause it really a bitch ass move
Why do you still think it's an insult for men to have anal sex? What if he's gay and loves getting down with endowed? Oh, I see, then you're just making a stupid rape joke, oKAy
@HPluckrose
Remember, folks. Sodomy/gay rape jokes are OK as long as theyâ€™re not coming from a conservative/Republican.
if you make jokes on rape, LGBTQ, someone's insecurities, someone's beliefs in a particular subject, body shame people or use gay as an insult im sorry bro but YOU are the joke

statutory rape and gay jokes aren't funny but by all means go off!!
Lucky enough not to be bombarded with comments. Put you in a certain stereotypes. Yes. I don't experience those. But I see how it tear someone special to me how all these happen to him everyday. GAY JOKES ARE NEVER OK. Same as RAPE JOKES ARE NEVER OK.
Ya know what's not funny? Comedians who make jokes about rape and gay people. Just so ya know Damon Wayans. But whatever.

Your understanding of good and evil is a little warped my friend - head chopping, child rape, dressing women in black sheets, gay killing and slave trading are in fact evil, all are prevalent in countries you love, like Syria, Libya etc. You are a joke and detached from truth.

#GamerGate @randomfox Oh God, the 'rape joke' lie again. EVEN IF that's where the colours came from, that was about gay sex, not rape.
RT @PainfulAugustus: @lilysboo i'm no sexist, i'm a realist
Rape jokes normalize rape culture. Racist jokes normalize racism. Gay jokes normalize homophobia. And so on If we draw a line and say,"these are not things to laugh at", it reminds folks that these are serious subjects that affect a lot of folks every day.

I was bullied by a big girl in Jr high, until one day, in my hurry I passed by her on stairs, a no-no, she pulled my hair, I reacted with a punch to her fat face, she fell back onto the sheep behind her and no one ever messed with me again, EVER!
When I was in 5th grade the girl that bullied me until high school looked at me and whisper yelled to her friend that my thighs were bigger than her head. Before that my grandmaâ€™s friend would always talk about my big legs and thighs
Disgusting. High school all over again. I'm a girl, but I used to have people judging me because I felt comfortable wearing loose baggy clothing. I was bullied by a few popular guys for not being girly, and called a "lesbo" by them.
LOL! Iâ€™m thinking that to truly identify with Napoleon, you had to experience some bullying in schoolâ€”and NOBODY was stupid enough to bully Petey at school!
I was bullied in high school because I apparently acted like a privileged white girl. I had no experience not being privileged and I quickly learned to hide it. I have ADHD and was rather impulsive with my actions and behaviors but suffered the consequences of those actions.

I was liked well enough. Bullied and called a f*g by the homophobes but people liked me just fine in general. Still friends with some people from high school today. They like me more now as a girl tho lol
I'd go just to tell the girls that bullied me in high school to fuck off. I was too shy to do it back then.
First the buffoon: trump claims itâ€™s up to State, local & parental authority. BS! If you withhold our/your kid(s) from school, heâ€™ll withhold moneys allocated, bully you, threaten you &amp; Worse have others do the same. He might go so far as to send out Border Patrol to confiscate
hyyh yoongi used to bully hyyh jungkook at school but later on, the other members all met each other at detention and yoongi and jeongguk became friends but jeongguk fell for yoongi when yoongi always played the piano. yoongi denies his feelings for jungkook because he's scared.-
Yup. Junior high. I was bullied, spit on, and shoved down a flight of stairs. All because I was a "Smart Girl". Administration did nothing.

i hate glee and how fake woke it was i watched it in high school as a so-bad-its-good thing There's an ep where they wear shirts saying what they get bullied for (that they're proud of/embrace) and the asian girl's just says brown eyes and the handicapped guy's says four eyes???
If you're ever feeling uncool just know that I was bullied by a horse girl in Jr.High

alt tik tok is slowly becoming the â€œthis is MY chance to be the high school bully to anyone who isnâ€™t altâ€ idc abt straight people but man... the stuff i see
So the word "bigot" here doesn't have it's normal meaning - it's more like being called a paki , yid , mental, lezzer by a school bully. You look around and see that no one is going to defend you for fear of being called the same thing. It just means "shut up and feel shame"
Hey Luca, Stone Cold Steve Austin here. I was bullied at school...My worst memory is when I had 6 boys against me on my own...but you know what...bullies are cowards and you are brave...don't let them win.
You canâ€™t be black, lgbtq+, AND be a coon like this. Cuz they will discriminate, vote against, bully, abuse, beat, and kill you for being the first two things. I know middle school was hard for you, mfs said I â€œwasnâ€™t black enoughâ€ too. But you gotta let that shit go slim.
I miss having a president who didn't act like an elementary school bully by coming up with 'clever' names for anyone he doesn't like.

Maybe. I think itâ€™s who Barr has always been and who he enjoys being. Heâ€™s a lifelong bully and power dominator Former middle school and high achool classmates have written about this.

Ask em if they have Instagram. So yeah never be Rude to your friends. Be happy and stay positive please. Anyway. I'm not gonna go further on this anymore. Irl friends are grown ass man. Their too old to bully people. You're in college not grammar school idiot.
DAVE URBANSKI Maria Jimenez's 16-year-old daughter told her she was being bullied by a group of girls at James Logan High School in Union City, California â€” so Jimenez and her husband Eder Rojas drove their... https://www.facebook.com/leslie.price12/posts/3220379004645950
she looks like horse girl that used to bully me in high school
I got sent to the principalâ€™s office in elementary school for fighting. Context mattersâ€”I more accurately got in the middle of a fight trying to stop a school bully from picking on another student.
Im sorry you had to experience this Unathi. That guyâ€™s life must be so crap to be that type of person. I actually feel sorry for him. Like the school bully, his the one hurting the most inside of all, and he acts out that way due to that inferiority complex.
What do you expect from Billy Barr (and brothers) notorious High School bullies. This is a replay of the movie My Bodyguard, with Barr shoving democrats into lockers, and swirlies in the Hill bathrooms. He was an ass back then, and remains one to this day.
Kiernan Shipka is the kind of girl I would have bullied in high school
It will pay off in the end my angel! I hope Richard Peakman is not teaching you! Heâ€™s the most bitter bully there! Made my life hell at that school! Keep going, keep pushing &amp; working hard!
i went to college to escape all the girls in high school who bullied me just to become a nursing student and have things come full circle huh
I am really accepting of people's religions despite being agnostic but Twitter Tradcaths make me wanna bully them like I used to back in middle school
So those of us over the age of 50 canâ€™t remember how our dadâ€™s told us to deal with bullies at school. I would say the generations that followed up to today have lost their pride and honor overall. But bullies always lose in the end
girls who bullied me in high school are bolts now and im greta von yeet
Itâ€™s funny how the girls in high school you were jealous of or bullied you are now crackheads or have 3 babies with different dads and canâ€™t figure out their lives. Itâ€™s honestly so funny.
Instead they think having 20 games of foot ball in a row is more important or to take the many minds off the CCP or more pay offs from the biggest bully in the school
Barr sits through all this looking like the school bully whoâ€™s been caught and doesnâ€™t know where to look while the principal gives him the dressing down he so richly deserves. Well done @tedlieu.

Being bullied at school: High-achieving boys use further strategies to maintain masculinity, for example becoming bullies themselves, disrupting the lessons, or devaluing girlsâ€™ achievements https://www.bipartisanalliance.com/2019/12/being-bullied-at-school-high-achieving.html?spref=tw
There was a girl in my class in 6th grade who was a little autistic, and her parents thought itâ€™d be better to send her to a public school. She didnâ€™t fit in with the class and was lowkey bullied (it was actually high key but the teacher downplayed it and did nothing)
Heâ€™s probably a white gay kid from some suburb. We donâ€™t want him to shoot up his school...so no one bully him.
You are pushed ti resorting. Treating thr bullies is you percent then from being pressured. Most school sitters evidence severe bullying. Treat thre bullies and it isn't a problem.
Today was an awesome day. Vivaldi called me a VSCO girl and Kali bullied my high school bully. I still can not believe I created my two best friends. I will never be lonely again. Life rules and being a mom is the best.
Trump is like that jealous little school bully who canâ€™t stand it when everbody loves the other guy.
oh and also, saying that weâ€™re on the same level of the columbine jocks just because we didnâ€™t add you to a fucking gc is so SO fucking disrespectful to dylan and eric. if you were a columbiner, youâ€™d understand that. we donâ€™t bully people into sh**ting up their fucking schools.
My high school life got better when I finally snapped and punched my abusive bully: hidd shocked expression and tears made the detention I got more than worth it.
I have collaborated with Ms. Luenavos and find her a strong force for good; not at all what Mr. White describes here. Feels to me like Mr. White looking to bully and attack. He's the wrong person to sit on OUR school board.

These guys shouldn't easily have a platform. I reported him on Twitch but I honestly have little faith anything will come of it. These sorts of guys are 100% why cancel culture should exist and exactly who I used to bully back when I was in school.

But not the bully everyone is afraid of, more like the guy that tries to be the school bully but no one takes seriously anymore.
Reminds me of little bullies at school with the â€˜you canâ€™t be in our gang!â€™ mentality.
2/5 of the girls who bullied me have kids, 5/5 of them smoke cigarettes, 4/5 have been on the run, 4/5 have been to rehab for failing drug tests. what am i doing? iâ€™m going to college to become a special ed teacher, i graduated high school, &amp; moved out right after graduation

School bullies:
So these people look like a "mob" to you. Mob: a large crowd of people, especially one that is disorderly and intent on causing trouble or violence. And as you can see, that not everyone there causes trouble or violence. It's like saying a bully defines the whole school.
@FoxCricket big wig acts like a 12 year old school bully towards a former fellow employee and doesnâ€™t like the public response. @FOXSportsAUS continue to show how terrible they are at who they hire and who they fire. #FoxSports
Itâ€™s like the â€œnot all menâ€ argument. I know not all Christians are like the girls who bullied me in high school because I didnâ€™t go to church, but enough of them are to make me automatically wary of all of them until shown otherwise.
Iâ€™m fighting for whatâ€™s right day and night, I feel like his foot is on my neck, he knows what heâ€™s done and he doesnâ€™t care. If we were in school heâ€™d be called a bully and heâ€™d be made to pay back and let us breathe #3MillionLivesMatter #3MLM #ExcludedUK @ExcludedUK @RishiSunak

I was bullied in high school for the same reason as your daughter so I would like to tell her it will get better, love your hair, it makes you different and special, you're a beautiful girl and those bullies are not worth your time.
Just like back in school, if you let the bullies bully you, they will continue to do so.
girls who bullied me in high school are time machines now and im passion
I read this post about how all the mean girls in middle/high school go off to college to become nurses. &amp;&amp; that did not disappoint bc the girl who bullied me throughout those years is a nurse now

this girl vandilized my parents house in high school, bullied me numerous times for being asian and calling me fat. she went out of her way to hate on me and be mean. the other day she messaged me saying how great i looked and asked me to buy her pyramid scheme. lifeâ€™s good :)
This â€œbrogrammerâ€ culture is specific to America, or at least i had not encountered it in Europe & was pretty appalled at how prevalent it is here in the US, starting in high school, where girls r bullied enough to drop Comp Sci. Major kudos to @BriannaWu I hope she is elected
This sounds so irrelevant. It's like a commentary on a couple of sub-intelligent bullies fighting in the school yard.
Jayapal didn't school anyone. She threw a childish temper tantrum. When she was a child, she was probably a schoolyard bully.

all the popular girls from high school are models now and all the girls who got bullied r egirls
The bullies at school were jealous of me. Even in year 5 when i was 10 years old. I was "the tall and pretty one"
Its not really a friend. It something more than that. Almost a family. Mine started 15 yrs ago. She's my bully. Hate seeing her. We always compete on elem school. But on HS i just fall in love with her. Not romantically tho. Just pure family love. Even on our 20's.
high school effing bullies
I grew up on a farm, when bullies in the preppy school i got transferred to for a year tried to mess with me, they didn't realize how growing up around animals ten times your size changes your perspective. Got disciplined for busting them in the nose but i got the point across!
just saw one of the girls who bullied me in high school after 6 or 7 years and itâ€™s amazing how anger can resurface at any time huh
It continues onto secondary school where we start competing with each other to achieve these standards. We fight each other and bully each other just so we can feel validated by being closer to societyâ€™s standards than our victims.
ykno being a middle and high schooler with a niche interest wasn't fun and i got bullied but looking back i'm really glad i wasn't a disney princess girl

This is what happened to every bully you ever knew in school. They donâ€™t change. They just get a badge so they can continue with impunity.

@bessonsruin she always complains about how blank makes her sick and how weâ€™re high school bullies lol
I would never blame my mental illness on someone else. like ever. I WILL however find it interesting that several girls who bullied me in middle and high school â€œlovedâ€ and â€œhuggedâ€ my latest fb post on self harm recovery. VERY INTERESTING
Looks at her and then down. "I told you I was bullied... And girls weren't really interested in me during high school. I got out of college and got into a relationship with this girl... Hot as hell but crazier than anything. She was pretty manipulative and pretty much ruined &gt;
Because she is exactly the type of girl they physically bullied in High School but arenâ€™t allowed to as adults. So they seethe their anger out of frustration
@Jim_Jordan Too bad you couldn't speak up over the sexual assault at UH when wrestlers told you what was happening. Bully big mouth for Barr, though. Coward/bully. Oh, Mr Law School graduate? Yes or No questions are just that, whether in Court or a Hearing.
I wonder how many girls she bullied to the point of suicidal intentions in high school while fooling the faculty with her faux cutesy persona.
you can tell she's been trying super hard to be alt since the beginning because she's always trying to put up this front that she was a nerdy girl who likes anime and has anxiety but she probably bullied people in junior high for liking it
Ah, so you were the school bully?
7 rings is a song that vibes with all the girls that bullied me. itâ€™s so like... if 7 rings was a person, it would be a high school girl telling other girls theyâ€™re fat and ugly

...but their school bully is leaving to join the government.
Oh god this is all of the girls who bullied me in high school as adults isnâ€™t it
yes but can't local government or else our workplaces, schools, private businesses like stadiums, movie theaters etc all "require" one? parents and school administrations will bully parents to get them..Then it pretty much becomes "mandatory" for normal life. scary..
It's a Catch22 situation when the President threatens to take away school funding if schools don't open up. He's being a bully. Moreover, when it only takes ONE person to bring the virus home or to school and spread it. It doesn't matter the location.
I really hope people are losing faith in that orange faced buffoon. I never had faith in him to start with. I knew he was a conman before the election & nothing has happened to change my mind. I donâ€™t understand how people like him. He is a school yard bully.
just found out the girl i bullied back in high school is still posting shit about me. not her fault though. i deserve it
Haha thank you! When I was a teenager I had a complex because girls bullied me in Jr High by fake asking me out, really messed up my mindset.
I always see this guy on the city bus who I used to be friends with in high school. We stopped being friends bc he gave my phone number to a girl who bullied me. Every time I see him on the bus, he gives me dirty looks??

yes bcuz I went off at a bully at school
this group of girls that bullied me in high school have all hit me up separately to hang out cause they think I look like someone they could just chill and smoke with... I wonder if they know who I am or know that their friends are hitting me up too? Am I being bullied at 25?
now whoâ€™s the high school bully...
so this girl had a seizure at lunch at my high school and went to the hospital. AFTER THAT ANOTHER girl says "oh she's just faking it" she got bullied for like the rest of the day after that

Sorry you got bullied by the pretty girls in high school

Idk how I survived being bullied in elementary school, junior high school &amp; fuckin high school. All because I was â€œquietâ€ or as they said â€œtalked like a white girlâ€. Shit was SO DUMB.

I used to get bullied by the popular girls in my school. Today, I am the popular one, and my bullies go to my shows. - @LadyGaga.
Girls who bullied me in high school are married to dudes like this now.
In elementary school, it was for being gay (They used to call me Tammy) In high school, it was for being clumsy and doofy (I won worst driver and accidentally hit a girl in the face with a carton of OJ that became a huge thing) Now: I get bullied for being too good looking
That sounds like the argument of a grade school bully or an domestic violence caseâ€”â€œWhy are you hitting yourself? Look what you made me do! Itâ€™s your own fault that you got hit.â€
The girls that bullied me in high school tbh
Tw// Literally makes me fucking laugh how shit my high school was. I got fully bullied on my school bus for 2 years bc I liked girls as my â€˜friendsâ€™ knew these assholes would be horrid if they told them. They used to legit throw scissors and rip cans open and throw them at me-
sharpay evens wasnâ€™t a victim . she was a privileged white girl that bullied everyone on her way to the top. literally canâ€™t imagine her as a serious broadway performer when she couldnâ€™t even handle some high school competition without throwing a tantrum.
What movie?
Not a girl from my high school trying to become an influencer and preaching kindness when she bullied me for being emo ummmm
Luca, school will end. I know it feels impossible now, but it will. Those bullies have hit the highest point in their life that they're likely to achieve. That is the highest point in their popularity. You however will be resilient and strong, you'll go onto achieve great things
What I got bullied over: Glasses, getting good grades, being fat, not going out drinking...generally being a "goody two shoes". And since I was verrrry shy around girls, some gay slurs, too. High school in the 80s was SO much fun.
jack morphed into one of my high school bullies
I feel like the American school system has this really........intense? culture?? community?? idk?? In a way?? I mean shit man, I just watched a court video and this girl said she was bullied in high school cos she wore the same clothes as middle school on the first day????????
Mandys tripping out that her dad and I have known eachother for 15 years. Wait until she finds out that he was my middle school bully
This all makes sense. It was the "mid-tier" girls in high school that bullied me the most. The truly popular girls were always nice, though... dismissive. I wasn't worth their time to hang out with, or pick on either.
Waking at 7am, stupid teachers, bullies, junk food, government propaganda. School is hell. Shut it down forever.

joey king did a whole ass presentation at my school about how she suffers from mental health issues and sees all the mean stuff people say about her but y'all continue to bully her because you're insecure and can't stand seeing a successful woman
The same girls who share all these â€œbe kindâ€ quotes bs are the same damn ones who bullied,judged,and talked shit about other people in high school fuck outta here
Hey Luca, my school days were like this but its not forever and I found amazing friends when I left school. I even confronted some bullies at a reunion and they didnt even realise how they made me feel at that time. I realised I was always better than them as a person x
i like the mean 20something girls bc i know they were bullied in high school too. thus i stand in solidarity of cunty girls everywhere
Starting at a new school mid-year wasnâ€™t Alexâ€™s idea. With no friends and a bully teasing him for being gay, life canâ€™t canâ€™t get worse. But, when his outlandish teacher assigns him a dragon as a pen pal it may start an adventure that can turn Alexâ€™s life around. #SFFpit #MG #FA
I had a friend from Noble Park High who got into Melb Uni in the 90s. She was bullied by one group of girls because she wasnâ€™t from a private school. They couldnâ€™t understand how such a person could get into Melb Uni.
Bullied in 3rd grade on the walk home every day. Then I got an aluminum bat. Hard for bullies to explain 2 broken ribs and an arm without revealing their heinous acts. He swithched schools after. Already 2 grades behind I imagine he grew up to be homeless.
but i try to keep in touch w my old friends from new york (i moved before high school began), which is only like him &amp; 2 other girls cause i was bullied a shit ton in middle school, so keeping in touch w old friends isnâ€™t that difficult cause i had like none lmfao
Most of my entire school life from k-8th grade. Still some in my 9th-12th grade but since my high school actually had teachers who actually cracked down on bullies and punished them my life became so much easier and stress free. Also the guy who bullied me the most is in prison.
Tb to when i bullied this girl in high school for having eyebrows that looked drawn on w sharpie and this queen took my man ..... good times

Being a white girl who is surrounded by people mainly of ethnic origin. This is not true. I was bullied in high school and my race was continuously used against me. What happened was disgusting but letâ€™s not use this as an excuse to be racist to white people who are innocent
If a kid is in school and the bully picks on that kid some of the other kids would rather join in and pick on that kid too instead of getting bullied by the bully. #Monday
Dental hygenisits were part of the mean cool girl group in high school except they got subtly bullied in private by the girls who became nurses
A girl in high school came in with a skirt that was deemed to short, I stood on the side of theirs nothing wrong with it, itâ€™s the same as boys wearing shorts, I was then bullied for not being a proper boy and not sexuallising her or cat calling because thatâ€™s the norm apparently
i bullied this girl in high school my 2nd senior year just because my ex friend told me some things about her.... a couple months ago i stopped being friends with that girl and decided to text the girl i bullied and told her i needed jesus in my life.

the bullies deserve the blame for that families grief by pushing alec to shoot up his school.
high school bullies.
acting mature at 13 years old in high school, doing what they do. i was bullied because of my physical apperance in high school. I was bullied because there were times iâ€™d be talking like a girl and my voice was not deep. I WAS BULLIED FOR BEING ME. and im still traumatized.
because who else is gonna bully me..... also youre like one of the only people from school i still talk to regularly
Nuggeting the schoolbag thing? If so dw you werenâ€™t a bully By boarding school standards you tame asf
School bully I bet
maybe today i finally wonâ€™t be scared of the 15 year old girls that definitely would have bullied me if we were in high school together when they come up to my cash
Pretty much all the girls who bullied me in middle and high school came out as lesbian or bisexual so itâ€™s safe to say they probably had crushes on me which led to them to bully me and resent me bc they had internalized homophobia at that time
all you bullies that was rude to me in school
For once a doxxing bully has been struck back. Washington Post settles Nicholas Sandmann defamation lawsuit in Covington Catholic High School controversy
You can try to coach the old school far left bullet head socialist bully out of a militant, far left NDP lifer but the mask slips occasionally or comes off entirely.
Thereâ€™s a reason the Electoral College is the system, otherwise the bully is in charge of the school bus. Remember this - some day it may be YOUR voice that others would like to silence.

It's also fully the same with this whole people calling themselves Goths now when they'd bully the actual goths in school. People who wear ket earrings defo look down at those with addictions etc
i would also like to add on a daily basis in my school (me and amber go different schools) these chavs are bullies, they personally made my life hell for a year but i got over it by calling them â€œchavsâ€ so if i or anyone wants to use to word â€œchavâ€ it is fucking validated.
I would like to assure you I was not a girl who bullied people in high school.
nah it's fine depens on the bully person i made 5 bullies of mine trough my school life my friends 2 of them i still talk to them daily. the thing is i like kept tanking punches without showing anything like emotions so eventually somehow we started habging out
Tell that to the Harley Davidson workers who lost jobs bc of your bullish approach to Chinese imports. I agree on being tough w China but your way of doing it hurts us almost more than them. Think smarter, more strategic, being the bully in grade school approach doesnâ€™t work
Iâ€™m a big fan of that Marines recruitment commercial where this young girl goes from stopping bullies at school to becoming one of the worldâ€™s biggest bullies. Shows you that you can be whatever you want to, despite what you were like in school
just found out iâ€™m on the close friends story on insta for the girl who bullied me in high school...
You mean after the spike in rape cases from the first day of the takeover? This is just like if all the teachers and staff were locked out of a school and the bullies took it over leaving the majority of the students in fear.
I heard on Pod Save Am abt a guy who grew up w Barr, same town in Texas, school, colleges. Describes him as a bully and a racist. There'd be a story of cops clashing w crowds, he'd say "I'd like to get in there and break some bones". Bullied him for wearing a civil rights button.

If I tell others that I'm pretty and bully others like high school popular girls, it'll make me better right? Um no, hun. Bullying just makes you a scuzzball. Treat others how you wanna be treated.(sorry I've been watch this POG champ post for a while, what a human turd.)
13yo Cassie hates the birthmark on her face, until she finds out itâ€™s proof of her destiny as a Guardian of Arabeth. Now she must face something worse than middle school bullies. A dark force that can destroy not only Arabeth, but her hometown as well. #sffpit #mg #fa
- threating disease. But it isn't. He was probably one of the bullies in school who made fun of a kid with severe autism. I pity these types of people. Believe whatever you want to believe in Butch, but science beats religion and your belief is false. Autism cannot be cured, -
Wiley is like the school yard bully where everyone makes excuses for him and their inaction to deal. Ethnicity does not absolve you of racism/antisemitism.
you can still bully us I just cba with the accent and school shooting jokes smh
Yes, well emboldened criminals donâ€™t get better do they. If you donâ€™t fight the school bully, expect to be picked on more.
thinking about all the mean christian girls who bullied me in high school who are now all married to men named like trevor and have weird looking babies
I like those shirts that say â€œBut First, Coffee!â€ And â€œOn Cloud Wine!â€ because they help me identify the girls that bullied me in middle school and got pregnant in high school.
All those popular student council girls that bullied me back in high school now following me on twitter because I'm fucking hysterical
Hyunjae: â€œthey used to bully me in schools and call me names like pretty boy â€
Command the rest receive. Divide up the uniform. Well it turns out the three new maids had known eachother. Back in high school two of them bullied the third. And it didn't seem like that dynamic had changed. When I returned the small timid girl agreed to wear every single piece
Oh! Good news actually love. I told you their daughter is in high school now, yeah? Well the spoiled little shit turned out to be a terrible bully(very unfortunate for her victims...;-;) but a huge group of bullied girls came last week and TP'd their entire front lawn!
indeed! They r emotionally extreme. The sons or at least one of their sons r pampered & adored or completely bullied. Girls r insulted or overlooked. #MAGA r 3rd &amp; 4th generation of these people. They fought blacks 4 scraps, too proud to unite.
Christine crying about being bullied in high school because she was just tall and beautiful and all the boys liked her and that made the girls be mean to her and jealous of her. I just â€”- #SellingSunset

Exactly literally we canâ€™t never progress as people if we are not allowed to?? This isnâ€™t high school where you bully people when they embarras them once and call them names months after. It literally just shows how petty person you are ://
This young girl got bullied in high school. So badly that she took her own life. Be kind to one another bro because you donâ€™t know wtf is going on with someone else. She a life to live. A dream to create. People to laugh and love with. #stopbullying #BeKindToEachOther
Yeah, until I started to fight the bullies that tried it (as the only half asian in a nordic school). Sure got suspended, but it stopped. Eventually Moved to another country into an affluent inter. school where bullying was reported, so kids avoided bullying.
I mostly remember only high school but Accidentally bumping into a popular girl in a lunch line (she talked mad shi about me w her friends) and bullied bc I got cheated on by my first love. great times.
In 4th grade I always got bullied by this one girl all the time cuz I wore a high bun, like would call me names, push me in the street, etc Itâ€™s crazy cuz I saw her again in HS, wearing high buns.

13) Last year of high school, I was at an all girls school, our choir sang with the choir at the nearby all boys school, we bonded over almost everything. My traumatized depressed bullied self learned how to love because of him. Sadly we aren't in touch anymore...
stop playing games. he was particularly evil about John McCain and you know it. he is a 3rd grade school yard bully. he wasn't invited to McCain's funeral for a reason. she shouldn't be defending this man, period. she is disrespecting her father and her family for her own fame.
I got bullied for being a â€œteachers petâ€ , being fat, and when I got into high school this old chucky looking low life girl spread a rumor saying my body was fake and plastic since my assets were to big for my age
if everyone has been bullied in high school then who was the bully
No.... but I did it to someone. In junior high. I was being bullied and one day I had enough and pushed one of the girls into a locker and did the kabedon. She must have gotten enough dokidoki after that because she left me alone. Lol
@sethmeyers Your 80's-High-School-Bully-getting-psyched-out is severely underrated.

I got bullied for existing????? Girls literally just hated me in high school. Never understood it.
3. Do girls get bullied for speaking in voice? Yeah. Luckily out of all my games Ive had it happen ONCE--doesn't mean it doesn't happen to others more--but I can safely say I've been bullied more in middle and high school than online.
Oh come on let me have some fun! I didn't get to be a mean girl in high school I was the one bullied and picked on now we've been bullied and picked on for 3 years and told 2 ton of Lies. Can I just do a little of it back?
WAIT YALL I THINK INCEPTION IS THE SCHOOL BOYS WHO GET THEIR ASSES BULLIED BY THE THANXX BULLIES
I bet if he fought back heâ€™d get him more trouble. Bullies have an eye for a victim, kids at my school that had time off for stress is so sad.
Female here. When has this ever been for 'beardy boys'? Also those same beardy boys ppl put down? They were often my only friends. The majority of girls at my middle/high school bullied me for being a nerd who liked 'guy things'. I got shit from THEM-not the basement dwelling guy
When I was in high school a group of girls always used to pick on me and try shoving stuff up my bum, man girls are evil at that age. I had to get therapy from that because I remember shouting "fuck off" to the little girl that bullied me and I felt awful after that :/ oof.
Just realized that all the girls who used to bully me in middle school and hs are either single moms, divorced, or dating someone who cheats on them and if thatâ€™s not the best karma ever idk what is
No bc he would be the type of person 2 bully me in middle school for liking kpop
Art was something I turned to when I was raped at 14 years old... It helped me go through the rough patches of my pregnancy... All through out high school I was bullied for being with and asexual and a girl who was confused about her gender... I turned to art...
Sad I went to high school with this girl, same to person to post about mental health and BLM then do this, bullying someone with problems and admitting she used to help them when they were being bullied by other people. sheâ€™ll get what she deserves

yâ€™all setting yourself up with these middle school krbk aus bakugou would bully him and deku at the same time
I publicly apologize to all the people I bullied in high school. Except @KaelynK16 . That girl deserved it.
Thatâ€™s awful! I was bullied in jr high. Girls are so mean. It was, surprisingly, gangster girls and guys who began protecting me. I was nice to everyone and I didnâ€™t fear them, the mean girls did. Worked in my favor. Some showed up to the 20th reunion. They shocked my husband.
I literally feel way more threatened by gender criticals. I'd take a trans person over people who bullied girls in high school for being too masculine looking and shit who somehow think its feminist now somehow, anyday.
Because itâ€™s sadomasochism that we have heard in any term of parliament before. We had a leader rise from a school bully one day, lost but not forgotten Australian Governments always say fair play. #SayNoToSchoolBullies
I got bullied for dating another girl in high school, for my weight, for being poor not believing in religion
Matt the school bully who gets into his first fight and gets fucked up.

i love how someone is trying to school me on how â€œbullyingâ€ works when they were the main one who used to bully the fuck out of me in school
But yet this little bully want to force children and teachers back to school.

Women arenâ€™t but girls 100 percent are - if you ever got bullied in high school you know this
Dude wtf are you talking about. Standing up to your bully at 16 takes fucking courage , busting your ass in school while everyone parties takes courage , being different takes courage. NOT FUCKING STREAMING YA TREE HUGGER
I just love going to my hometown and going on tinder/bumble and seeing girls from high school who bullied me for being queer.

they are gonna get SO MUCH SHIT at school when the bully googles their names and finds loads of posts about how they pooed the bed back in 2017 or some other random parenting thing that should have kept to themselves!!
Poisoned chalice.She won't be accepted down there. A school bully who will be totally out of her depth. Without media mythology, she's a substanceless husk. Her &amp; lady moanyface are same ilk. Plus once Scotland is independent her revenue stream will be cut! It'll be a paper title
I specifically noted this issue is bigger than Mark Kern throwing out his nerd cred and saying his opinion is more important because of it. This is the same guy who bashed on a female celebrity because he was bullied IN HIGH SCHOOL by girls, and as such he says they aren't gamers
My hair, that i was â€œstuck upâ€ because I was insecure and shy and quiet so it came across I guess that I was a bitch. I was bullied by a few different girls throughout middle school &amp; high school &amp; was told to just go in the bathroom &amp; cut deeper next time &amp; no one liked me.
. this isn't high school you cannot call people bullies and expect to be taken seriously
â€œCall me school bully, you miserable little tick.â€ ^Simon

girls who bullied u in high school love to make sure their RN name badge is in every one of their facebook profile pictures
I got the chance to stand up to a girl who bullied me in high school today and it felt AMAZING.
Luca: Stand up to bullies &amp; make them accountable. Why should you keep changing schools when youâ€™ve done nothing wrong?Talk to teachers &amp; even to the bullies themselves if you can, in fact talk to anyone whoâ€™ll listen. Life is full of bullies &amp; only by exposing them will it stop.
Nothing helps you CHANGE like hitting rock bottom. At 17, I was a skinny twerp still being bullied in high school. One day I tried to hit on a girl I liked. She declined politely, but her insecure meathead boyfriend overheard me. THREAD
id respect the girls that bullied me in middle and high school so much if they just said sorry
Jenna apparently was bullied in high school and now feels the need to be the mean girl, along with Adam....#BelowDeckSailingYacht
She was apparently a bully at school aswell. Some never change.

Wow!! Doesnâ€™t supprise me they would talk that way about someone. There like bullies in a school. All they do is lie lie lie. Show needs to be canceled.
Periodt iâ€™m really skinny bc of genes and my mom got bullied as a child and got called â€œskeletaâ€ which means skeleton girl in spanish.
the weird flashbacks i had today from middle school and that just because i met one of my bullies yesterday, i was literally crying for a whole hour. i hate it here
i wonder if high school popular girls who bullied people know that or just lived in oblivion of their own actions and impacts?
In my school the PE teachers were mostly paedos or bullies.
Bullies in school are depressed now
i can't believe taylor was bullied in high school, she legit looks like those popular girls that bullies the new kids

The Left seems to attract the worst kind of busy bodies and curtain twitchers, I think. And they are willing to go to any lengths to force you to think and act and believe as they do. They were the bullies back in grade school. Really cowards.
there was a girl in my high school who bullied someone so hard that they started doing coke but everybody think sheâ€™s a saint because sheâ€™s attractive and gay
I think it just a form of many jealous people Mr DJT. Sort of like the bullies in school that talk bad about the smart kid, or takes the kicks away from the cool kid, or takes lunch money from the kid who has to actually pay for their lunch. Bullying only goes "1" way
2015 you looks like a kid i'd bully in high school but damn, that's a good fucking glow-up
[For non-religious reasons] I tried this with a hoodie in high-school, got bullied, and called a chicken head. This girl is rockin her shit and I am so fucking proud of her!
Yes absolutely!!! Every girl who bullied me in middle and high school all became CNAs. Iâ€™ve not seen one actual RN out of them.
The first person that bullied me had green eyes The person that bullied me more in middle school had green eyes The girl I liked back in high school and I never got the guts to tell her I liked her because I was afraid she secretly hated me had green eyes
the girl who bullied me in junior high is a nurse now like this is so funny folks who traumatized me during my early formative years are doing great in life and here i am just Gay and stupid but damn at least my fashion sense is Great
A high school girl in Central Java was severely beaten by her classmates in school, later it is found the victim has disability. The authority responds by asking the victim parents to move their daughter to a special school so she wont be bullied anymore. Wrong.
Dakota you literally told me this same girl bullied you in high school shut up LMAOOO
Come to think of it, my high school was wild af. There was this one girl who got bullied due her appearance, to the point she got hit on the head by this dude using an empty water gallon. Nobody helped her and they just watched her being bullied, smh.
The bully at a school or at work that complains that nobody likes them.
I wish I could expose the girls who bullied me in High school because these bitches were racist af and thatâ€™s why I was bullied for calling them out.. they hella silent right now.
She bullied girls at Wayland high school Watton Norfolk years ago as my daughter was one of her victims !! Leopards never change there spots
https://twitter.com/robbiie__/status/1191755359188377601?s=21 it really shows how dull he is when heâ€™s on TV and canâ€™t just call someone a nonce or a melt. Love this video, itâ€™s like watching the school bully realise no one likes him.
I'm in school what the fuck do you think you're doing trying to ring me and then bullshitting when I decide to tolerate your wank talk
I donâ€™t agree- @AOC tweets derogatory things toward other people &amp;groups all the time&amp; put other people down&amp;sheâ€™s given a pass all the time because what?!? Why?!? As a woman she has offended me often-I never followed clicks - #AOC is like the #bully all knew in high school
Guys who used to bully everyone in school are sumo drivers now.
four high school albums // please donâ€™t bully me, this music is all GOOD
Yes I only care about the ones in America because I live in America and donâ€™t want my future kids killed because of someone broken pride. Like itâ€™s not that hard. If you stop the bully where he stands of letting it get so far as shooting up a school none of this will happen
So far I'm on chapter 4. It's been about her father mostly, and how he was tormented by his father and Donnie. Mom was too ill to do anything and Donnie was such an out of control bully he got sent to military school
the girls who bullied me in high schoolâ€™s celebrity crush was ansel i-
This was the line that struck me too. We have truly been abandoned in the sickest and most egregious manner. And now they expect to bully us into returning to a â€œnormalâ€ school opening.
We didn't have many bullies, just a lot of mean kids. I hated to see anyone get bullied. I got in many playground scraps defending kids. Funny bc to my old towns website on FB and a tall thin kid I helped still remembers. We were in Elementary school. He grew grew into a big guy.
I was bullied &amp; my anxiety controlled me everyday! I was bullied by a 300+ lb lesbian, the vice principal in high school &amp; a pregnant girl in high school! Plus many other bullies, it took many years for me to be comfortable in my skin and be confident ( sometimes ). 1/2
Very emotional movie. High school girl deals with something that she can not control, her height. She was bullied. Make sure you watch it till the end. â€” watching TALL GIRL
He shot up a school, fuck the dude. He deserves his sentence
For the most part, they're the people who were the biggest assholes in high school, the bullies and failed jocks who could barely maintain a 3.0 GPA. There are some who aren't total rageaholics, but even then, none of them are your friend.
I mean I did get bullied for a short time but I still don't think middle school/high school girls are that mean, esp as you get older
Also fuck guy who say girls are ulgy without doing her makeup or hair. I'm happy I have the Boyfriend I do who actually loves me for how I am. I was bullied all through High School for not wearing make up. I have never warn makeup unless it was for something special
Those bullies in high school were right. I am ugly and will never be shit
Damn @Faxxu_ thanks for lending me that Lambo for my cousinâ€™s high school prom. It really made it so he wouldnâ€™t get bullied anymore and is now prom king and is now dating his dream girl! All thanks to you and your generosity
Iâ€™m glad I wasnâ€™t in high school when VSCO girls were a thing they definitely would have bullied me
All of the girls who bullied/were mean to me in high school for not being pretty enough or cool enough are having children and i hope that they let their children know not to be bullies like they were bullies when we all were in high school. And thatâ€™s the tea sis
David Arquette Reveals His Daughter Coco Has Been Bullied  http://t.co/rXQOEXc
Bullies feed on fear. I stood up to the school bully in 8th grade, fully expecting to get my a$$whipped. We fought to a draw. He ceased to be a bully after that and I ceased to be cowed by bullies. Do whatever you think is best in a given situation.
HAHAHAH ONE OF THE GIRLS THAT BULLIED ME IN MIDDLE/HIGH SCHOOL HATED THE WORD MOIST HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Being an ex Muslim is a big money making thing these days and everyone is jumping on it... Now you have become the school bully and following a crowd picking on Muslims &amp; Islam without even knowing anything about it... Getting ur information from islamophobes
Itâ€™s crazy cause ya girl was getting bullied up until sophomore year of high school
Real shit!!! Yo i bought all black knee high converse &amp; wore em to school cause I wanted to look like a scene girl, mom even straighten my hair and did the side part and I got bullied so bad I literally never wore them out again just in my room doing emo looks
You're so void of any common knowledge that all you can do is bully people bout their size &amp; looks. Once you graduate from 11th grade in high school, then we will let you come play with the big dogs. Until then, just keep up your little grade school bullying. @AnnCoulter
ur so disgusting !!!! i cant believe i looked up to u bcs u defended me against high school bullies
The study you cited in the pic showed that girls who bullied more people had more sexual partners than girls who scored high in honesty-humility traits. Guys can still say yes or no. Why is it okay to blame women for sleeping with mean guys but not the other way around?
Lol so this guy was impersonating a cool guy in his high school that bullied him because the guy didnt show up to the reunion, , everybody bought it except one girl and his friend knew
Someone who used to bully me in middle school for being chubby just slid in my DMs No thanks, bye.
Anyone else notice that the girls who post "you matter" on Facebook are the ones that bullied you in high school?
i judge other people body's in my head sometime, but before high school i used to bully one girl and i regret it ever single day
middle school bakugo would bully kirishima just like midoriya, the only difference is that kiri would try to fight back (but probably fail cuz...yk..."im not manly enough")
So this probably going to come off rude but... There were this group of girls in high school who mercilessly bullied me because of my weight. Cut to 5 years high school graduation, and they've gained weight and now they're not understanding why people are saying things to them
These two old mamas were obviously bullies in secondary school. Disgusting #bbnaija

Don't know about the school bully but would have been funny watching him try to escape the school leopard.
The girls who bullied you and peaked in jr high and high school are now ugly with a bunch of ugly kids and ugly baby daddies lol
Riding in the truck with my dad. We see one of the girls that bullied me in high school walking across the street downtown. Forrest: â€œDo you want me to roll the window down and yell something obscene at her?â€ Dad, quietly but confidently: â€œHEY UGLY!â€
tw// mental health the girl who bullied me in high school just said sorry to me and i don't know how to react but cry, they gave me such a hard time in freshmen year to the point where i only attended half of sophomore year and attempted s*icide at least twice a month
I just REALLY love girls who literally bullied me to drive me to cut back in high school talking about mental health and how important it is. Youâ€™re still a bitch, change my mind
@LaraSpencer @GMA. I bet you also laughed in school when your lunkhead boyfriends would shove the quiet, â€œdifferentâ€ kids into lockers. You were/are the quintessential mean girl who bullied and mocked anyone different in high school to make sure you looked cool. Mean ainâ€™t cool.
Gun girl: constantly talks down upon minority groups and constantly dehumanizes and berates them Gun girl: why am I being bullied off college campuses with high minority rates :( theyâ€™re obviously terrorists :â€™(
that was in middle school, in high school this one girl had a real problem with me but i have no idea why lmao but i was past being bullied for no reason so it didnâ€™t really affect me. the middle school bullying is the source of my social anxiety though
Teens with night-vision cameras spy on school bullies in #fantasy #mystery The Heart of Applebutter Hill by Donna W. Hill. #StopBullying https://allauthor.com/book/3544/
So why does she look like one of those popular girls that bullied me in high school that I totally drooled over for 4 years ????
This looks like those canned Facebook messages MLM girls send to everybody they bullied in high school.
Do you not understand Vaush is arguing and making an issue a thing he doesnâ€™t understand. He bullied the girl he debated in a stream days later, he made a comment about â€œis it bad optics to ban black peopleâ€ and he unintentionally argues for white supremacy
Please Guyzz Retweet and Share this as much as you can. We are common people and for #SushantSinghRajput sir we have to do this. They all bullied, Tortured him and literally killed him. It's high time for us to come together, Enough is Enough. His fans must accept the truth.
They both look like girls who would have bullied me in high school
In high school girls not guys would tell other girls that refused to have sex with their SO that theyâ€™re not worthy until they put out. Itâ€™s sad that girls are being bullied that unless they put out or have sex theyâ€™re not worthy or good girlfriends.
I no longer site in school, so prefect of society, the police who over use their powers on me are traitors and bullies, judges who believe everything they say give those muppets who bully n get away shit god status. I do not belong to bullies n I do not need to be paid to defend
these are BULLIES these are HIGH SCHOOL FUCKINGBOOLIES
It's ironic how the people that bullied you in high school told you crap about the way you would do your own makeup back then, now msg you to ask you about makeup tips. Girl Bye!
itâ€™s so funny that the girls in high school that thought they were the shit are now doing everything that they bullied all the girls for. like being gay, dating out of race, you name it
They used to actually bully Yoko as well in Timothy goes to school like she used to get it bad and I'm telling you now it was a racism thing
Morrison really is the school bully.
Pretty sure at least 4 of these girls bullied me in high school #TheBachelor
Itâ€™s funny how the girls in high school that â€œbulliedâ€ everyone and weâ€™re straight cunts are going to school to be nurses, doctors, etc. PRAY for our future
The way my high school bully literally lives rent free in my mind
Your blog is great Mabel and I feel sad about children feeling embarrassed to wear glasses. One thing that annoys me is the cliched image/story of the school bully picking on a child who wears glasses.
I used to look sort of homeless but now I look like a 30 year old cast as the bully in an 80's high school movie
I never really loved it there. Iâ€™m not a POC, but I was still bullied by girls for the first 2 years I lived there (continued on the full 4 years, but it died down a little). I only was there for high school &amp; then left for college &amp; moved to Atlanta right after college
I got bullied for being the new kid, hanging out with girls, being fat, accused of being gay, actually being gay, and because they were bored in high school.
the girls that bullied me in middle/high school follow me on all socials and are the first ones to watch my stories on Instagram
the tone of this tweet oddly reminds me of the girls who bullied me in high school
Jack, the quintessential bullied by girls in high school soy boy, is trying to play puppermaster. Running interference for the NWO.
our so called president is a bully he treats women like a piece of meat.. calls people who don't agree with him name's like a damn bully in school..and this is a leader of people. nope don't think so..
Seems to me you are 31 years of age, moved to Toronto at 16 for university. Expeienced some marginalism for being Asian and now somehow feel that Chinaâ€™s rise will teach those high school bullies a lesson.
Whatâ€™s up with box tops and why did my school bully me into collecting them
this is gross if I went to school with all yâ€™all mfs i beat you all tf up call me Highschool bully
Once again Jerry Nadler is the kid in grade school that bullies steal lunch money from and give a swirlie to.
man that reminds me of our media when we make high school or collage into a wonderful place that we party every weekend and gets the pretty girl but nope study trying to fit in into the school society or get bullied.
Funny you reference the high school bully. Jeff is that old guy who was bullied throughout school for being weird and sees tweeting at Trump as his personal revenge of the nerds. Unfortunately, Trump, much like the popular girls in Jeffâ€™s high school, does not know he is alive.
Sometimes I think about the bullies who called me thunder thighs all throughout school and then remember I can change my thighs but they canâ€™t change their ugly personalities!
all of them look like theyâ€™d bully me at my locker in middle school
Iâ€™ve only hated one person in my life, a White girl who bullied me in high school. I can only guess that it has to do with untruths that are shared and passed down. Also, born and raised haters or a personal experience like mine. Human nature is not pure.
thinking about my primary school bully ayva if you're out there i hate you
Joyce. Thatâ€™s my mother. She was the biggest bully there ever was no matter where I went to school. School is where I went to get away from bullies. I grew up in a family of malignant narcissists like Trump-Not Trump voters-Trumps. 9 of them. Iâ€™ve predicted everything heâ€™s done.
I ran into the school bully Jeon Jungkook he looked me up and down before his best friend kim taehyung walks by "ayo arent we going to Jackson's party gay bitch?" I gasped Jeon Jungkook is gay?
If lavi comes back im heading tf out like a high school bully who leaves the table when the girl she doesnt like sits except I'm just being petty cuz lavi made me wait too long now he has to wait for ME
Right? Bully mentality. Like heâ€™s still in middle school.
Ah, that's good. I know I had some people criticise me for using humour, but it has always been my coping mechanism. Used it to disarm bullies at school and fallen into that pattern all my adult life.
in middle and high school; my tribe was the art snobs, the skaters, the fashionistas, the emo-Avril-Lavigne-taking-back-Sunday-paramore crew.. i fked up trynna hang with the ratchet cheerleaders or the girls who were super bullied for being corny who told everybody business
I absolutely would have been bullied by VSCO girls in high school. I would have never been in charge of my hydration like that!!!
once knew a girl who wore thigh high socks and was p much a furry, and i bullied her so much that she had a crush on me, and even more so that she left my school
Watching girls who straight up bullied people in high school act holier than everyone makes me wanna ram myself into a wall
well itâ€™s apparently a school full of stoners and i heard that they think its fun to make fun of and bully neurodivergent people and say slurs so i probably wonâ€™t love it there but i might find a few ok people
Worst - being bullied in primary and high school Best - when I finally fucking left an all girls school for a co-ed
Me when I bullied tf out of this girl in high school for dying her hair half red and black like mine
I had a verbal, "Girls can't do physics." My high school physics teacher bullied me and two other girls out of his class within weeks. One remained: my friend Debbie. She stayed the course + went on to do an engineering degree. One girl with physics in my whole grade! One.
The kid hung himself because he got bullied for being gay? Damn, fuck the bullies. Fuck posh schools.
Yâ€™all think high school bullying is bad ? Try being a girl in a dominant male work environment and literally being bullied to the point of embarrassment and tears. Iâ€™m talking about grown ass men bullying young women. It ainâ€™t cool and it ainâ€™t funny.
Like I donâ€™t know what this ladyâ€™s experience was in high school, but mine was LOCKING MYSELF IN A BATHROOM STALL to change because the CIS girls in my gym class bullied me so viciously that that was the only way I could feel safe. But I guess that doesnâ€™t matter to transphobes.
You tweet this like it"s a bad thing. We want progress. We don't want to go backwards even further with trump who's never progressed from being a grade school bully with Daddy's money.
@Tulane @LSU are these the type of girls you want representing your school for the next 4 years?? theyâ€™re BULLIES.
I'd love to remake "You Again" (2010). It's a blah movie, but the premise is so good: A successful woman returns to her hometown for her brother's wedding only to find that he's marrying the girl who bullied her mercilessly in high school. I'd keep the Betty White parts obviously
I was never bullied. But in gr11 the popular guy I had a crush on from day 1 of high school asked me to be his girlfriend. He took me to the volleyball wrap up party. One of the popular girls whipped a scotch glass at my head bc I wasnâ€™t pretty/popular/good enough to be w/ him
I'm from Paducah. I was bullied. I have, for the most part, always been a big girl. In school, though, I was active. I was on the Swim team and was in Civil Air Patrol. I was made fun of for my weight almost constantly. That's why, in high school, I became anorexic-bulimic.
Blackmailing schools. Either you take the kids and let them die or no funding. What kind of a fucking president are you?! Playing games in the oval office. You constanty scare the people you bully. You have such a low niveau!
Yes, of course - and we will. I just really hate it for your girls. I can still remember what it was like to be bullied in high school, and no one did or said anything about it. I hope your school's administration does better for your girls than mine did for me.
Looking back at Facebook messages between me and girls from high school. What a fucking loser I should have been bullied to death
The girls whose boyfriends bullied me in high school are commenting on my pictures of me in drag saying â€œgo offâ€ or â€œ â€... like are you forgetting that you allowed your boyfriend to call me a faggot and cause years of trauma?
This isn't a 'women' thing. This is a bitchy alpha mean girl who probably bullied people in high school thing.
girl iâ€™m not abt to be bullied for being â€˜smartâ€™ when in reality my old high school did it differently. no maâ€™am
So the SI (stupid and ignorant) index reads: Brexiteers Climate Deniers Anti-maskers Tory voters Racists Flat earthers Tommeh supporters Thunberg haters LGBT ignoramuses School bullies Delinquents and many more.
Bullies in school really were like: "Hm, I don't like who you are because I hate who I am." And we were like: "Omg this is all my fault it's my fat :(" wtf lol
this is what the girls in high school who bullied me for being too pale looked like lol
He just mad because he ran into an old school bully that said "Yo Hoo Yo Hoe" and he took it out on Miss 'O'
you know what I take it back. people at school donâ€™t bully the kids who have / look like they have special needs
Shoutout to my school bullies for making me the person I am today
I was bullied in early high school. Then lost thirty pounds, learned to sing and play piano, gained an extra ten pounds of muscle, and graduated dating the hottest chinese girl in school. Living well is the sweetest revenge, banging the girl they want is even sweeter.
â€œMost anti-bullying programmes target all students, saying that bullying is not acceptable but they do not impact the students who will bully, the potential perpetrators." #bullying #school #education #student #programme #Irish #socialentrepreneurs
Literally half the school shooters I remember the name of were bullied mercilessly until they started pulling triggers. Alec McKinney DOES NOT GET A FUCKING PASS just because his identity was the subject his bullies latched onto.
Gay catholic school life was getting into fights and the teachers/principals only yelling at the bully because they know your gay ass ainâ€™t start it but finished it
Back in high school My friend was getting bullied at lunch one day and she put her black belt into use and straight up kicked the dudes food tray into his face when he wouldnâ€™t back off. Sheâ€™s great, pretty sure sheâ€™s just Texan Tank Girl
I stood up bullies in high school. I started an anti bullying program for the schools in my district. Why in the hell would I condone this behavior.
On the other hand, I never bullied anyone, I always tried to help others, and I tried to be kind to everyone. I passed every test put in front of me, and dropped out of high school in my junior year. 8th grade a girl said I brought a gun to school. +
I believe when Sarah and Chris were at school they were school bullies because they bully people without thinking about their feelings
We'll find out when the federal government steps up its campaign to bully parents into sending their children back to school.
mine was liam aka my brother who made a whole school bully me(:
I did the Faceapp thing on a coworkerâ€™s phone and the girl filter gave me straight blonde hair, which looked like a normie version of myself that would have bullied me in high school.
A girl, that Iâ€™ve never spoken to, told people that I bullied her all the time in high school and threw food and drinks in her face in front of everyone in the cafeteria.....
That girl who bullied you in high school, probably has "be kind in her bio" Alright then hun...
RICARDS LODGE HIGH SCHOOL (Wimbledon, 2013-14) - A group of mixed raced and white girls bullied and called Asians â€œPak*sâ€ but the school did nothing to prevent it despite receiving several complaints. Asian girls and hijabis are bullied at this school but no one bats an eyelid.
this is what happens when u donâ€™t bully the weird kid in school
The incompetent Minister of Health @shandro has very poor impulse control. Abusive bullies promoted by @jkenney who virtue-signals about decorum but then leads like it's a grade school recess. #abpoli #ableg #UCPcorruption
In jr high a girl â€œbulliedâ€ me and spread rumors about me saying I was a lesbian bc I was best friends with a lesbian. Keep in mind I had bfs in jr high Well I get on Facebook and SHE JUST GOT MARRIED TO A GIRL! Wow. Just wow. I will never understand
Have you ever found out that the girl who bullied you in high school is an anti-vaxxer who is also against wearing a mask? Because that feeling is really something special.
Many students figure out who they can bully and get away with it based on how the school staff treat certain students. Iâ€™ve had students think they can talk about specific students to me as if Iâ€™d join in. Made me wonder which teacher(s) allows that
The way I enjoy Taylor Swift albums nowadays reminds me of how my best friend from law school ended up being the guy I thought would bully me
Someone posted in my high school fb group and itâ€™s good to know that all the girls that bullied me peaked in high school lmao
I know a girl who used to go to the same high school I went to who once bullied a girl in our class for being a lesbian and now sheâ€™s all over Twitter and sheâ€™s like â€œIâ€™m a lesbian and proud she/her â€ like excuse me? .
THAT ONE GIRL WHO BULLIED YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL GETTING MARRIED... Too accurate!
wedding vows of the girl who bullied you in high school and her maid of honor trying to overshadow her
Iv known her since primary school she use to bully me not gonna lie I still know her to this day weâ€™re friends and sheâ€™s nice and quiet
Trunp sounds like a middle school bully at a psychotherapy session. Ouch.
I can understand the point of why lesbians and gay men say this, but also I am bisexual and Iâ€™ve been called a faggot and a dyke before from holding hands with another girl or when I was bullied in high school. Yes I donâ€™t experience the same as a lesbian, but Iâ€™ve still had +
You fought in a few school playgrounds with a few bullies. Women have to to fight misogynists and sexists and bullies in every workplace, university, hospital, restaurant, dinner party, job interview, twitter feed in the world. It doesnâ€™t stop when one set of bullies goes away.
#drtwtisoverparty WHY IS DANGANRONPA OVER??? WHY?? IF ANYTHINGS OVER ITS MONOKUMA NOT THE VIDEO GAME AS A WHOLE! I AM OUTRAGED BY THIS COMMUNITY OF BULLIES!! THESE ARE BULLIES. THESE ARE HIGH SCHOOL FUCKING B U L L I E S HOW ARE THEY GONNA COME ON HERE AND SA
Kawaii (cute) culture for adults is pretty normal in many parts of the eastern world. (Japan for instance) Itâ€™s the west that shames anyone over 4feet tall for wearing cute stuff. I wonder how many girls get bullied out of the cute stuff they love in JR high by peers. Itâ€™s wrong.
seeing happy a girl who was bullied in high school is my fav thing in the whole world
Hypocrisy or outright lying? School programs against "bullying" aren't heeded by so-called adults who cave to sly bullying (propaganda) by rioters, local/state politicians, corrupt preachers, &amp; sports figures. Such bullies promote bowing to &amp; agreeing with anti-American values :(
I watched TUF and they reminded me of school bullies which I've seen before as I'm a teacher. Must have been an absolute head wreck being in that situation and stuck in the house.
Me: I freaking hate clichÃ©s Author: the school heartthrob habitually bullies the introverted loner girl, but he accidentally falls in love with her Me: *sobs* omg the school heartthrob habitually bullies the introverted loner girl, but he accidentally falls in love with her
This girl my sister went to high school with who constantly bullied her and would post mean things just once again brought her up to just be mean 6 YEARS AFTER high school. And like, thatâ€™s really pathetic. Talking shit about things that happened in high school? Really?
she did share that she was bullied for being quirky/nerd/ in her high school. It was obvious her bully was a Black girl. I think Ember and Woods are to sides of the same coin.Hell I wish they had found each other earlier.
Iâ€™m the popular girl who bullied you in high school, but now you just pay me to bully you... funny how these things go huh
Toxic people in video games are like those bullies in school who would talk shit about other kids to make themselves feel better... like Kyle I get it your nicotine addiction has you a bit on edge but to be real life mad at people on the internet?
Werenâ€™t we taught in high school not to bully people online? Just my high school? Okay
Oh I learned this in a big way in 6th grade!! I was friends with this one girl in 4th grade who moved schools halfway through the year. When I reunited with her in 6th grade, she was one of my biggest bullies. Turns out she got bullied when she arrived at the school before me.
thinking about how yâ€™all really bullied that girl for celebrating getting into all those colleges.....how sad does your life have to be to log onto this bird app and decide to hate on a high schooler being happy.
Selena. She gets bullied on every social media app. People say she's overrated but tbh she's underrated. She has more haters than lovers. Even the GP hates her because they believe any lies. There are even beliebers and arianators at my school who bully me for liking her.
Now I got on one aspect of why I hate Hillary so much. She is that high school girl that bullied poor girls. Granted she might have waited to do the slut shaming when she was covering for her rapist husband. But the fact is she bullied women with less power than she has.
Probably because a lot of them were the mean girls that bullied in high school.
the fact ateez went from pirates boy to school bullies boy really sends
This was me. I was bullied by black girls in middle school and only had latino and asian friends. Then romantically, I was only interested in black men until the guy I liked in high school (he was black) told me white girls were better. Now I date men of all races.
I imagine it will make those who feel their ancestors were oppressed, feel better. I think of it like this. If my neighbor put up a statue of my awful ex GF, or a bully from grade school, or a horrible boss that fired me, I would be pretty adamant that it is taken down...
was ur school normal or did ur PE teachers still bully u to do PE even after handing in a doctors note ab anxiety
If youâ€™re in secondary school right now and being bullied I hope it gives you some comfort to know that your bullies have probably already peaked but you will flourish as soon as you are out of that toxic environment just wait and I promise life after school will be amazing
that is the age group that trump's brain is stuck at, except he is a sociopath bully moron according to his own mother whom he disrespected so much she sent him to military school Those boys are better than trump could ever be and pray to God no boys ever grow up to be like trump
I got bullied from elementary school to high school, I was just labeled a loser, I never knew how it started or why. Most of the bullies where boys and some girls but they did it all behind my back..
I am so sorry you were treated that way. Itâ€™s awful! I was bullied too in jr high relentlessly by two Mexican girls because I wasnâ€™t Mexican enough for them. Hate is 100% taught! #anythinghatecandoLOVECANDOBETTER
My son and friends were bullied by a girl for a year. I raised my son not to hit. Year two in high school, she comes back, punching them in the face, my boy told her the next time he was hitting her back harder than she hit him. Problem solved. There's no fair fighting now.
Itâ€™s wild that all the girls who bullied me in high school think I might actually buy their pyramid scheme makeup today.
Ah, lots of modern,young politicians seem to belong in the â€œupper left quadrantâ€. There are a few SNP councillors who remind me of being in the school playground.I see them as bullies but they act like â€˜butter wouldnâ€™t meltâ€™...they make me really angry. Is this why?
Rebecca Black Quits Middle School After Bullying
middle school white girl bullies named britney in disney movies be like:
As a trans youth, I would not shoot up my school because of my bullies. You donâ€™t speak for us, and neither does Alec. Yes, weâ€™re hurting. But NO ONE should take it out on innocent people who had NOTHING to do with your pain. For shame.
I was bullied in high school and Iâ€™ve also struggled with addiction. I am thankful to be able to use those negative experiences to help my girls through life!

This sounds like grade school. If the bullies donâ€™t like someone you canâ€™t like them even if they are good people. They probably wonâ€™t invite you to their next birthday party. In Nov. can we please elect some adults.
I was once bullied in High School together with my 3 friends, all because we are very conservative. It was crazy how they called us names. Even girls are laughing at us. I felt like a loser. Even now that I'm already working, I never did forget a thing. #ENDviolence #LoveYourself
my timehop just reminded me some girl from my highschool dead ass bullied me for the FROYO place i worked at lmaoooo high school was crazy man
I got bullied for my eyes being big. And one girl was obsessed with the thought that I wanted to steal her boyfriend. (Which I didnâ€™t) so she made high school hell for me
Girl bullied &amp; assaulted on video leads to parent's outrage at Montwood High School administrators https://www.kvia.com/news/education/sisd-student-assaulted-now-parents-want-change/1121659642
did the bullies at school give you testicular tortion when they pulled your underwear up over your tiny head ben? would explain the squeaky voice and the constant need to punch down...
I went to high school with one of these guys lmao. Mans came out so arrogant and played with a girls heart then broke it by saying he didnt want her to be associated with me cause I bullied him in high school when i'm sure we spoke maybe twice and i barely knew the girl. Nasty.
Honestly Sydney is the worst. Apparently she was bullied in high school but here she is gaslighting other girls? Yikes #TheBachelor
I wish politics never existed. All I see is bullies in a school yard brawl! Nothing peaceful at all!
Lolol this white woman on tv just said she was bullied for being tall, blonde, and pretty in high school because girls were jealous of her. Pray for her
@PressSec Kayleigh u r most definitely not a Karen. My 23 year old son uses that Karen the mayor lightfoot using it was sooo immature. Over the past few months these politicians have been acting like school yard kids and bullies. #TeamKayleigh
Ugh. Friend of mine in high school was a eurasian girl who was considered "asian" by the white kids and "white" by the asian kids, and got bullied by both. She's now utterly stunning and all those boys are "Welp, fucked that one up". Kids suck.
Poster children for hypocrisy and scared children trying to avoid the school yard bully.
Seabreeze High School: Justice for African American Special Needs Student - Bullied by two white girls Savannah and Chelsea - Sign the Petition! http://chng.it/K7dZKSnH via @Change
Illegal? Really? I should be able to arrest all the bullies at my school if THIS is illegal.
A very narrow majority of people voted for a butterfly strewn unicorn paddock with free beer and eternal youth. They're getting a kick in the nuts by the school bully who's just shat on their doorstep. Brexit was a dream that's turning into a nightmare.
Force integration came to my town the year I entered Jr. High. For 6 years whites were bullied by blacks. Were we scared? Absolutely! I had to be walked by administration to my car for not giving up my assigned seat in science to a black girl.
I'm NOT saying that every person studying Nursing or is a Nurse is a mean person. I know PLENTY who aren't. I'm just saying that all the girls who bullied me in Middle/High School are ALL Nurses now. Like. WTF.
Hi so yesterday I had kind of exposed some racists at school and one of them sent me this his IG is @/caleburban8322 and his snap is @/caleburban22 Ik Im a small account but pls spread it bully him all you want heâ€™s so racist AND DISGUSTING
Dido got bullied as a kid for being called Florian Cloud de Bounevialle Armstrong. What the hell?! That is an amazing name!
Yes, and it's not just a bit thinner. A fairly average girl in the Western world would likely be called fat if they went to high school in Japan. I'm not saying her weight is bad, but it is incredibly unrealistic in this context. The entire game would just be her being bullied.
My friends told me that in their high school, a guy with autism was bullied by 3 girls. Those girls deserves to be expelled and not suspended for 5 days only. I believe in justice and karma.

Charlie is the school bully I didnâ€™t know I needed in my life
I got bullied viciously all through high school by girls. Once they sprayed me in the face with deodorant in the changing rooms. When the turfs say trans women make changing rooms unsafe my only response is hollow laughter
A little boy I worked with who was in kindergarten got bullied because he liked to braid the girls hair. A direct quote from other kids: "only GIRLS braid hair. Are you GAY?!" Again, these are elementary kids. Imagine these same kids by the time they reach middle/high school
Can we talk about how every major â€œfilled with girls who bullied you in high schoolâ€ are just majors with majority women? Nursing, education, communications...
My parents and most teachers knew about it but as said, it was taken as a joke, and nothing was done. "You don't get bullied, this is a bully free school!"
all the popular girls who bullied me in high school have the absolute worst eyebrows and are part of some kind of pyramid scheme now. proof that God is real.
All the boys and girls at my high school wanted the tall girl. She was like 6â€™6, thick, and nobody ever bullied her. So Iâ€™m confused.
They are nothing but high school bullies reliving their glory days.

these are the type of bitches who used to bully me in high school.
What kind of books do you usually like? I write A PNR/UF mostly, and this is my bestselling series: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082GGB7WL But I also have a high school bully romance that's a lot more rated R than PG-13 LOL
Classic bullies. They don't differ much from the immature high school bullies. They're characters who none of us have power over &amp; for them to cast you away cause you didn't "play" with their favorite the same way is unfair. Ur not a liar or a victim. Ur human and theyre bullies.
So sorry- that stuff stays with us forever. I was bullied for 8 years, I moved away right after high school to escape it. They once spray painted â€œBITCHâ€ &amp; â€œBURN IN HELLâ€ on the side of my house. My school principal told me to â€œget tough friends â€œ. It was a nightmare. Hugs, girl.
â € â € â €Yep,that's the girl that bullied you in high school. â”€. . .And yes,she's still a bully to this day.
YouTube striking down videos talking about pedophilia is like the school punishing that kid for standing up to the bully. Check this out:

i used to be a dance major i was really in love with it and i quit right before i moved to high school bc i was afraid of the dance girls and i thought i was gonna get bullied and manipulated. i ended up leaving the school anyway
I got bullied in high school and college, had friends turn away from me when I really needed them, was in a manipulative relationship, and was sexually assaulted several times. I had a girl who I thought was a friend turn everyone I knew against me and even threaten to kill me 6/
I would take the red pill for the sole purpose of walking into school and punching the bully square in the face. Possibly multiple times. Likely multiple times. Oh, and curse out the principal. Then leave that school and go to the better one I ended up at.
Iâ€™d like to exchange this high school bully for a friendly jock type plz
Like I was never taught until a way to late how to play rugby league/ union, as the game I played with was only bullies, who aimed specially to hurt me. Like schools maybe should actually teach them basic tools to play these games, so when not in PE, know how to play them saftly
i remember i bullied this girl in high school because she had these boots that looked like they were made from duct tape and once my paper tore and i asked her for a piece of her shoe and she started to cry and now i feel super bad about it
I remember in school there were the bullies - but there were also the kids on the side who would backed up the bullies and in many ways they were the more nasty The people on tonight defending Rachel Riley despite her non-stop bullying remind of those kids

i was bullied through primary and high school. years of crying to myself in my room because of mean girls.
In high school I got pretty viciously bullied by boys for being the chubby goth girl with bad acne. Girls were cruel too, but in very different ways. The boys were scarier for sure.
a girl in high school constantly belittled me as a person and bullied me and was only sorry she got caught and in the end she hurt so many people no one liked her or trusted her tenderness and kindness is strength
i fell bacj into the spacetime by five years im 15 again. im a freshman in high school and my only worry is not getting bullied by the health sciences girls for wearing hot topic shirts
Facebook is just full of girls that bullied you in high school sharing quotes about the importance of being kind laughable
Local public education is operationally controlled by the States not by the Federal government. The bully pulpit at the Federal Level should not dictate the opening of schools. #schoolsreopening #edchat #education #parents #teachers #educhat #edu8

High academic achievement puts boys at a higher risk of being bullied than girls, possibly because it makes them appear un-masculine. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11218-019-09539-w
idk how to explain it but the MOST racist small town american super bitchy bullied-me-in-high-school and peaked at 17 years old girl type thing to do is model for a southern fashion boutique on insta and pose next to that dumbass brick wall at a weird angle
I had a weird status in High School. I was a weird kid, a bully(sort of), not popular but widely known.
The school yard joker, friend of the school yard bully. If Navarro had a brain he would be dangerous.
My mother was never home, my sister was a bully. I was presented drugs, but I turned them away. I was pressed to steal things, but I didn't. I was pressured to skip class and drop out of school, but I didn't. They putt them selves were they are, white people had no hand in that
One girl bullied me in class in high school I laughed at her. Pissed her off so she tried to punch me in back of the head between classes. Someone warned me, I ducked &amp; blacked out. When I came to folks told me I had beat her with my bag filled with heavy books. She was bloody.

that one girl who bullied you in high school after getting a job at starbucks
you are so lucky you are a child and i have an iron defiencey, or i would 100% beat you up. youâ€™re annoying and nosy. youâ€™re the type of kid named kyle who would bully me in high school and steal flavored wine coolers.
In high school I was bullied for being too sweet &amp; pretty for the ugly, bitter girls to handle Smdh. I thank them for teaching me how to box. They picked on me so much, I had to learn how to fight to defend myself. Iâ€™m a quick learner tho, so it all worked out.
hit someone, i might just look like the guy your ex cheated on you for or just your bully from school. who knows. . . âž he gradually trailed off but snapped out of it when they let go of him, taking just a step back. the sudden intimate gestures was making him feel weird. &gt;
Norm I just followed you. I wanted to smack Barr today. He was arrogant and did not take this hearing serious. That cabinet are all a bunch of high school bullies!
girls who bullied me in high school are watercolor paints now and im handwritten letter
I share your concerns. When I was a kid, bullies couldn't post cruel things about me to the entire school. Now... the bullies are everywhere. But, then again, there's kindness, too. We just have to work extra hard to foster kindness in ourselves and our children.
dating your middle school bully be like "remember that one time you told me to kms?
Thanks to watching Mean Girls at 7, I was only bullied during elementary school, but knew how to handle situations better in high school.

Besides all the visible stuff, short, hairy, fat, other...I was most bullied for being...HAPPY. Other girls thought I was "fake" because I was genuinely excited about life. I also didn't understand sarcasm until late high school b/c first gen immigrant &amp; my parents never used it.
this girl looks like every mean bitch in high school who bullied you and then goes into nursing because shes â€œso caring and empatheticâ€ also she has a really punchable face js
They're the bullies we all knew in school who kept telling everyone they were going to become cops.

svt r mingyu bully club they meet in the quad on wednesdays after school
girls who bullied me in high school are romantics now and im magpie
People who say that high school cis boys would pretend to be trans to see girls naked in locker rooms really think that coming out to your family and classmates, taking hormones, and being bullied is easier than asking a girl out on a date
Why do these pasties look like a group of school bullies hanging out in front of the local Greggs?
Shoutout to all the girls who bullied me in high school, they look 45 while Iâ€™m aging backwards.
Watching all the girls from high school who bullied me for wearing a size 14 lose their diet minds on Facebook as we slowly ascend to 35 makes me feel torn. Part of me wants to be their body-positive sherpa, the other part wants to laugh at them a lot.
In elementary school, to bully me, people told me the Titanic wasn't real and I cried
I really am about to delete all social media the way people comment about celebrities and famous people like they their school bully or best friend is wild like take your negativity and built up hate and journal that shit donâ€™t put it on twitter jeeeeeeeez

I went to high school with this girl who was a rape apologist and tried to date this known rapist who i called out and apparently YEARS later she is telling people i work with that i bullied her in HS and this is the funniest shit i have ever heard in my life
Oh girl. I grew up in the 70's / 80's with grade school through high school. I was bullied with name calling, freckle face, fatty, poor, ect.. the one that hurt the most was when the mean girls in gym class threw my clothes in the trash. Today I am strong.
Well, bully for you, Bloomquist.
The girl who bullied me in high school had this purse
Love that I have to log on and cyber bully my high school
Love how all the girls who bullied me in middle school in high school preach positivity and feminism. Girl where was your feminism when you were telling me kill my self or calling me a psychotic bitch when you never met me? There is no integrity.
Love seeing a girl that bullied me in high school at the gas pump next to me then grinning as you make eye contact. Hi itâ€™s me! I did get prettier thanks for noticing :D also thanks for supporting my ex that use to abuse me!
Why is this allowed? Our country isnâ€™t free - twitter is the segregation our country tried to destroy, twitter likes their best friends and bullies the ones that arenâ€™t like them, Twitter is the fascist high school Newsweek that only allowed their own group think, itâ€™s pathetic
I just remembered a girl that bullied me in high school just asked me to help her with her programming homework and Iâ€™m laughinggggg
Mind you, Greg Davies has an air of school bully about him.
Im really proud to say Iâ€™ve never been the girl that bullied ppl in school growing up. I actually wanted to fight the bullies
I was lucky to not be bullied in high school, but I had trouble with my faith in my religion because I found out from my older sis that one time, a group of girls from church called me weird...
Publicly humiliating your child isnâ€™t it. Send him to a military school if he acting out. At the end of the day he was a CHILD. As a parent itâ€™s your responsibility to take care of your childâ€™s mental and physical welfare. His daddy was a bully.
Did your high school have a FB group dedicated to posting prom dresses where girls would bully other girls who bought the same dress as them or did you actually enjoy high school
Plenty of better word choices.. I learnt to stop it when I had my first child..â€it was a .. this is not how my children should see or hear me behave.. it worked till they started primary school. I was not expecting that from 5-6 year olds.there was also entrenched bully behaviour
This petty grade school bully has to one up Fauci like he tries to one up President Obama, always falls short. GOP has made a mockery of the profound importance, grace and dignity the presidency requires and the people deserve. They put a clown in the Oval.
My reaction when girls who bullied me in high school want me to take pictures of them
I often think about in middle school when one of the worst bullies in our grade got called a gorilla and was so fragile she had her mom absolutely freak out on the school and we had to have an assembly about NOT calling her a gorilla. canâ€™t be a bully AND that sensitive sixuzuhka
A girl a foot taller than me bullied the fuck outta me for half the school year because I was tryna take the high road. I beat the shit outta her so bad she started going back to church and hanging out with the well behaved church kids.
One time I saw the girl who used to bully me in middle school wear a Joy Division shirt from urban outfitters and I stg I was about to cry :(
i feel like i should say something soft and encouraging like everyone else but i just want you to know if i went to school with you i wouldâ€™ve fucking kicked those bulliesâ€™ asses into next week. anyway, you got this far and thatâ€™s proof of your endurance.
The girl that bullied me in high school got corona

i think itâ€™s a good concept. itâ€™s about a high school girl - who feels bullied and doesnâ€™t feel she fits in. why does everything have to be about race. because sheâ€™s white you wouldnâ€™t watch it? interesting.
I had the biggest tits in high school and I am allergic to perfume, so the other girls always bullied me and set off my allergies, *riiiight* before our mile runs every week. What did my PE coach do? Squat. Let it happen.
The thing w/ the evil tiktok nurses is SO funny to me because I can literally open Facebook and see the profiles of 95% of the girls from high school who bullied me and others have careers as nurses/carers !!
I just saw someone post about how their middle school was â€œall Coldplayâ€
do u guys remember the bully buster club in middle school?
why would she be nominated for looking like a high school bully 24/7???
Bribing the school bully with someone else's sweeties.
Girl who bullied me in high school just asked me for hair bleaching tips. Imma tell her 40 volume and to start at her roots
This was everyday at saline high school and Iâ€™m glad I was able to get out of there. The things I heard there were terrible. Kids would scream the n word at the black students, a girl with a hijab was bullied out of school. Part 1..
â€œI am absolutely scared of uâ€ -Thinks is a disease but uses -idk yâ€™all have like1 friend at school -U probably tried to bully me@in middle school -U think ur on alt tiktok but ur not -please leave me alone
A promise to teachers: â€œHereâ€™s what I wonâ€™t allow. I wonâ€™t allow #BetsyDeVos, the SOE, and DT, the President, to bully school districts and states into opening schools before we have a proper plan in place.â€ ~@PAAttorneyGen
Oh btw, i met the girl who bullied me again back in high school. We were even classmates lmaooo. Idk if it was just me or what but she still looked at me like she was still disgusted at me. But I'm cool tho, we were just 5yrs old. But still, kinda sad looking at who I've become.
iâ€™m trying to tweet more but iâ€™m still traumatized from the time in high school some girls found my twitter and bullied me for being depressed lol
when i go back to my ghetto ass school i gotta change my aesthetic because they gon bully me for being a soft girl
Millie, you keep your head up high. I was bullied in school and I let it change my schooling. Bullies are wimps, they are cowards, they are not worth you worrying. Show them each day that they will not win, you look a sweet little girl. Enjoy your life don't stop being you.
dont bargain my loyalty on cost of losing the heart he laughs on this foolish heart who knows nothing other dan loving him he bullies my faith on believing d soul connects my old school of thoughts may be a misfit, bt wins countless energies in d universe #jyotichand
I'm glad that Shitty Gamer Takes is quitting, the person behind it punched down on small users (by sending their hate mob to attack them), bullied a girl in high school, and only showed bad takes from one side of the political spectrum, so on top of all that they were biased.
A high school bully was murdered last year. While I personally forgave many of the bullied at school and accepted apologies, I remembered him being particularly vicious towards girls. I buy that he'd changed, but I only remember who he was.
Those popular High school bullies probably become nurses, doctors, and in law Inforcement, because they like controlling people and having power over the unfortunate and I hate it
Got bullied for wearing glasses, getting high grades, getting a lower grade than usual, for not liking what's 'trendy' for being a not-pretty girl, and probably the most stupid thing I got bullied for is: liking things "normal girls" don't like, such as fiction movies Â¬.Â¬
https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2019/09/09/florida-boy-bullied-for-homemade-university-of-tennessee-shirt?cid=share_twitter. I hope the girls that bullied him feel about an inch high right now! Just stop the bullying! Schools need to step up and do a better job as well as parents! Bravo to UT!
I dont consider a 3 month training program for high school bullies qualifies said bullies to be A honest about arrests B not criminals themselves (40% spousal abuse rate) and C arresting without bias. Your faith in strangers who have been handed guns is strange
I was the awkward girl, the one everyone takes advantage of and constantly bullied on. Body shamed, abused..... high school was my hell.
Mom brutally attacked by teen girls outside CA high school; confrontation over bullied daughter https://buff.ly/39XGf5r from @abc7
Imagine being a 30 year old man so intimidated by a woman being better at something than you that you make up rumors & bully her I graduated high school years ago bro
I still have the Greek and Persian mythology story books I got when I was 4. I read lots of Angela Brazil at 12 â€“ was miserable being bullied in inner-city 'sink' junior high; it was an escape into a world where girls were generally kind, well-mannered and had friends.
I probably would have felt largely indifferent if I learned that one of my bullies died. And yet I somehow managed to get through all my school years without even so much as contemplating murder.
That feeling when girls that bullied me in high school buy my sweatshirts
also one time in high school, a really nasty teacher tried to fail me so i passively mentioned it to another teacher who later confronted and basically bullied her into giving me a passing grade. a year later, the teacher who tried to fail me was fired!
bullies. high school bullies
If I snoop around your house, will you like it? US must be highly uncivilised in snooping around other countries. If others fly around US, I think the US Air Force will shoot them down immediately. As usual, US looks like the typical school bully.
All these nurses and medical professionals on tiktok keep outing themselves. People are shocked by how awful they are but none of this BS surprises me. There are kind nurses but a lot of them behave like the mean girls that bullied us in high school.
My mom rap sheet speaks for itself and she used to stab mfs who tried to bully her in school so yeaaaa lol
Junior school was St Andrew, St David, St George &amp; St Patrick. Senior school was Bullies, Worse Bullies, Snobs, Thugs &amp; Layabouts - it was a posh all-girls school
I was lucky I wasnt really bullied for this in my late middle school days and not at all in high school. But early middle school I was bullied somewhat by mainly guys. Girls didn't really pick on me thankfully. They just thought I was more of a tomboy and left it at that
Don't worry, it's impossible to bully me. I was bullied from age 4-11 by a massive, horrendous girl (and her mother once, in the playground). When we went to high school, she kept on. Then one day I saw her in the corridor and switched. I shovved her into a wall and kept going.
yeah, he was a nasty bully and this fight was over a girl, which everyone at school knows! listen to the audio and you can hear the white kid is clearly not starting it
omg shut UP so many ppl say that and i feel like the high school bully so now i will kiss the ground you walk on!
I was bashed by a boy at 5yo every day for a year. I was called a slut & bullied for being a tomboy who loved playing footy with the boys &amp; having guy friends (the girls were jealous). That followed into high school where the bashing &amp; hatred continued for the same reasons
my middle and high school bullies thought the same its fine
10 years post high school you come across your worst high school bully ever. You're their new co-worker. What's the one thing you wish you could say to them but you know good and well you will never say?
HELP WANTED: Someone to bully me into doing laundry every 2 weeks. All are welcome to apply* *Except if you bullied me in middle school. I've seen your work and it's not that effective.
Cheong Ah: "That high school girl got bullied for two years, her friend suddenly turned her back on her, she didn't know why and was too afraid to ask. Waking up every day was a torture, going to school was terrifying." Me: #BeautifulLoveWonderfulLife.
If you were/are a lonely, bullied, "gifted" kid in high school, this book is for you but it will also hurt you.
Sheesh... the girls that bullied me in middle and high school all going through it on Facebook. Congrats on the baby though
why don't you go fuck yourself , public school bitch
Good kids feel safer with police in the schools. The only kids who donâ€™t like to see the police around are the bullies and the druggies.
Attacking people out on Social Media is pathetic, dudes acting tough for likes, one of them will bite back sooner or later. Beware the Wolf in Sheeps clothing. Reminds me of a school yard bully who got fucked up by the skinny kid he picked on.
Every group needs it's good cop, I guess. I never understand the mentality of people who do what these women do. I've seen pro-lifers who do it as well (and I try to avoid them too) but no where near the level of the pro-aborts. Twitter turns adults into middle school bullies.
I sometimes think back to some guy trying to bully me in high school and going â€œyouâ€™re uglyâ€ and my reply was a straight faced â€œoh yeah I know. Totally agreeâ€ and I think I broke him. you canâ€™t be meaner to me than I am to myself. GET IN LINE.
omg You literally bully me @school ???
I canâ€™t believe I let bullies from elementary school stop me from rocking a middle part most of my life
like first of all you bullied me in high school. and secondly, your hair is still dry as fuck. now get out my messenger with â€œhey girl!â€
This is so inspiring! I was bullied even in high school for having hair on my arms. It makes me so happy to see girls supporting girls
..... I swear.... This is your fault in the first fuckn place.
I never really bullied anyone in high school but I did convince my whole school that a kid in my gradeâ€™s step sister was the girl from Cake Farts.
my kids ainâ€™t getting a phone until they start middle school and iâ€™m beating up whoever bullies them. they finna get the childhood they deserve.
To every girl who bullied me in high school, congrats on your ugly babies
Mine was mostly school bullies and total strangers in the street (!). I grew up in Cyprus, where telling someone they've put on weight in considered some sort of public duty. But hugs!
Iâ€™m only stating this because I witnessed and was told on multiple occasions of her talking shit on me and other girls. Itâ€™s not the end of the world lol like ok her and a LOT of fucking girls bullied others in high school. Its really not that deep, we all have shit itâ€™s ok
IM SHORT TOO but i was always super yâ€™all in elementary school #5â€™4since5thgrade
The arrogance and aggression from a section of Scottish society towards anyone whose politics are different is shocking and shameful. If this is how they behave as adults, I dread to think what they were like at school. Some of these folk must have been prolific bullies.
Looks like girls that bullied me in high school for wearing skinny jeans
Ik ive been serious lately but this hit hard, to the girl that bullied me in hs, I was already going through a rough time and school was my safe haven, she was just the cherry on top for me to go from straight Aâ€™s to flunking bc I didnâ€™t plan living past high school
Canadian schools are reopening because Canada has a functional federal government and has actually flattened the curve.

Thereâ€™s really nothing like picking up a side gig in your hometown and then being sat with your sisterâ€™s high school bully for Sunday brunch #timesiamthankfulforamask
I was overweight and awkward AF in high school. I listened to metal and spent all my spare time playing video games or doing extra homework. Then I lost loads of weight, dressed in more fitted clothes. Suddenly all the girls who had ignored me or bullied me wanted to be friends.
She was a really nasty bully, at high school too apparently.
guys rlly graduate from high school then suddenly get fetishes for the girls they bullied huh
Thanks for making me miss weeks of school, thanks for making my grades drop, thanks for dumping me for my bullies. I hope your life becomes complete with them
I was bullied a lot in primary school and junior high. Even girls used bully me ku last kwa grade 9 I grew taller
Imagine if cops were trained, qualified professionals instead dumb school bullies gone pro.
That's a bit rich you telling people they should be ashamed of themselves for how they are treating Cummings when you bullied a 9 year old autistic girl and called her a complete twat. You are such the high class citizen we should all aspire to be #Hypocrisy
luckily he goes to my school so iâ€™m gonna bully tf out of him
The main reason for most of our anxieties are the school teachers. They bully and discourage you more than your classmates or any other person. Knowledge doesnâ€™t teach you morals. Except few kind all others are devil.
but not like. cannibalism as in "oh my god you're so hot let me eat u" more of cannibalism like "look honey i made u dinner it tastes funny doesn't it yeah because it's your high school bully. bon appetit". thats hot
Donald Trump was that bully in elementary school who would tattletale to the teacher if anyone stood up to him.
Before you shoot your shot with a girl you bullied in high school, remember the shit you said to her, and apologize first. Don't just pretend like you never took jabs at her. SHE REMEMBERS.
I got bullied by skin color was too dark for them and my hair was too bushy. threw gum at me. Pushed me. Harrased me every day. Pulled my hair. I was a quiet little girl made very good grades. middle school years, first high school year were horrible
Iâ€™m 6 feet tall and I did get bullied in high school and was super insecure I donâ€™t get ppl acting like bullying doesnâ€™t exist to those girls. It looks dumb but Iâ€™m not mad at its existence
Black girl at predominantly black high school. Got bullied for being smart. Got bullied for my love of rock, kpop, 80s music and because i watched anime. I spoke proper english which meant i was "talking white" And most of the bullying came from my mother.
Mom brutally attacked by teen girls outside CA high school; confrontation over bullied daughter
there isnt a thing people could say about me as an adult that will get under my skin because nothing makes u harder than getting bullied in middle and high school. u could say the worst things imaginable to me and i guarantee u some 13 year old girl did it better
Think about how emotionless I wouldnâ€™t be if yâ€™all didnâ€™t bully me in school. But now I donâ€™t care &amp; hardly anything effects me so I guess thatâ€™s cool too.
one of the girls who bullied me in high school for being bi is dating a cop which is just *chefâ€™s kiss* perfection
One day, these kids that they are teaching to be angry, are going to be bullies in school; and eventually school shooters.
You probably would have bully me in school
My dream is for one of the girls who bullied me in jr high to follow me because they donâ€™t know itâ€™s me and then Iâ€™ll tweet â€œone of you is a girl who bullied me in jr high and donâ€™t know itâ€™s me. Iâ€™m funny now huh?â€ And then all the mean girls will sweat thinking itâ€™s them.
Filthy Rich Boys: A Reverse Harem High School Bully Romance ( BURBERRY PREP)
Always cracks me up how all these internet â€œwitchesâ€ post themselves casting curse spells/hexes on dumb trivial anecdotal shit like their ex bf, intolerant parents, or high school bully... instead of trying to punish rapists, pedophiles, billionaires, murderers, or dirty cops lol
I love that all these girls who bullied me in high school are all of a sudden feminists lol ok
I hate a bully or sister? let us make a peace agreement between our people and yours if Jesus don't hate Judas? and five fool virgins? the school teacher didn't say that then. has he ever repent? now I heard he died in the prison.
Total incompetence! Another bullying tactic from UK government to push us into a UK holiday to boost their economy! Money before health and happiness as always! Send school staff to work at risk without PPe but BULLY the public to stay in Uk. A disgrace!
Pretty sure @NYGovCuomo only buys online at Amazon and shops at Walmart, which is why he is allowing every other place to die. I've also got from a reliable source he was bullied in school and was told he had cooties which explains why he now bullies the state.
Confessional: growing up I used to hate my voice because I used to get bullied all the time for it. â€œYou sound like a girlâ€ â€œwhy your voice so highâ€ it was a insecurity of mine. NOW I DONT SHUT THE FUCK UP
Whoa...Is this the same Ted Cruz that went screaming to the media because Donald Trump attacked his family like a grade school bully? Yep. Same Access Hollywood Republican. Same guy.
To all those girls who bullied me throughout middle school and high school: howâ€™s nursing?
The teachers at my school never really punished the bullies for verbal abuse at my school either. No justice was served, all that changed was me, I became stronger. Now I fear nobody, and I say that sincerely not egotistically. One day you'll look back on this and laugh.
... wilbur is 6'7... yeah most DEFINATLEY he would bully me in school
adobsonartworks: Seriously. I see this mentality ALL THE TIME. â€œI was bullied as a kid, therefor I should be able to bully others.â€ Iâ€™ve said it before and Iâ€™ll say it again, â€œI got picked on in high schoolâ€ and â€œgirls donâ€™t go for nice...
Bruh hyunjin from stray kids looks like my former high school bully I-
Sometimes I forget I was bullied every year of my life from 1st grade up to the end of high school. From when little me picked my nose in class once &amp; some girl screamed about it &amp; then the class made fun of me for years to my senior prom. It's easier just to forget, though.
When one of the girls who bullied you in high school messages you about her pyramid scheme
This is so cringe to me. I love yoga and have gotten so much out of it, but I stopped going to classes partly because I was uncomfy with the fact that the instructors were all 22-year-old white girls who would have bullied me in high school. I'm good with Adriene tho.
Yall remember when it was trendy to do that kool aid dip dye hair and all the popular girls in middle/early high school did it and would post shit like "yeah I dye my hair crazy colors, I'm me and I'm not sorry " meanwhile the actual scene kids were being bullied
Sweet, cool, smart and the other a school yard bully
1. I worked three seasons as an entertainer at a Holiday Park 2. Iâ€™ve never kissed/touched/seen a girl naked 3. Liked other boys since I was 12 4. I have an intense fear of marionettes 5. I would sing in our end of year high school assemblies every year despite being bullied
Rebecca Black dropped out of school because she was bullied. Woah.
Conservative party of Canada is either embittered loners who see their high school bully in Trudeau or trads who blame all their personal shortcomings on college kids with opinions. Liberal party are debate club and theatre kids who also happen to want coups in Latin America
Iâ€™m not trying to be mean but Iâ€™m not gonna lieâ€¦ Seeing a lot of the girls who bullied me because of my weight in high school gain a lot of weight after I lost 85 pounds makes me really happy and I love seeing karma at work Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
When the Transmen came at my head, they werenâ€™t being informative, they were acting like lil school girls, trying to bully me into submission. Thatâ€™s why i wasnâ€™t receptive to shit they were saying. You canâ€™t come at me like that cause im not no punk or bitch and Iâ€™d slap you IRL
A girl is bullied all her life until she makes into a private high school where finds out her kindness pays off and finally gets the friends sheâ€™s always wanted... until HE showed up. Can she manage to continue her wonderful life and stay away from him... her first love and &gt;&gt;
i felt so helpless back in high school when i was bullied. even worse when my female friends would stand up for me, it made matters worse bc i let girls fight my battles, well atleast thatâ€™s how my bullies interpreted it, mocked me even more bc of it. what a bad vibes time.
I don't care if the chance of children dying is virtually 0. We must protect our children from virus', bullies, and gender classifications. Special schools need to be built to protect our fragile babies.
Nerdy kids, kids with illnesses, High School girls that arenâ€™t a size 10. All in danger of being bullied.
My middle school bully came into work today
I knew plenty of girls in highschool who were bullied for being tall. Yeah, after high school being tall can be seen as a great thing. But the point op is making is that if it was just about a tall gangly girl learning to love herself the movie wouldn't be that bad.
Shit, I donâ€™t have a nose ring rn because some of my own friends from high school along with other girls told me my nose was too big. So I will never feel sorry for white women getting â€œbulliedâ€ for being white. Suck it up, snowflake.
Really funny new Marines commercial where they imply members of the armed forces were the kids in school who stood up to bullies
Laws my nephew just asked me to come to his daycare to whoop the kids who bully him at school ..... welpppp, guess ima be fighting some kids tomorrow
Girls who bullied you about your acne in high school really will message you on Instagram and be like â€œlong time no see please can you recommend me some skincare productsâ€.
After 10 years though? I let all that shit go. Iâ€™m super grateful for everyone I met and grew up with during that time. Even my bullies who all later apologized to me. Also I look a lot better since high school so I wanted to show off and be like TOMA COÃ‘O
jokes on the girls who bullied me in high school because now i have a sick complex where im hopelessly attracted to the kind of girl that would have bullied me in high school
â€œItâ€™s fun, itâ€™s just so much different than muggle school, Zara explained, â€œbut being known as Hermioneâ€™s baby sister has certainly kept the bullies away, I see how some people treat other muggleborns,â€ For that, she was thankful for her big sister!
I once had a dream that you were the popular girl in high school and I was your gay best friend and we bullied Gracie Gold
In middle school I use to be insecure about being mixed. I got bullied because kids didnâ€™t understand how a brown skin girl could have a strong accent, long hair, &amp; exotic features. &amp; then I hit High School...everyone was obsessed w/ foreign mixed girls. The bullying stopped
Itâ€™s a lot of girls who bullied me in high school that are making themselves skinnier on Instagram. Yâ€™all never hated me. You hated yoself
Itâ€™s just the politics of our times have changed. These politicians do not respect decorum. They are basically high school bullies and if you donâ€™t hit back, they continue to step all over you. Primila didnâ€™t seem to have a problem with Barr after she reclaimed her time.
School was never good for my mental health, at least High School. I got bullied by all the pretty girls, and they always treated me like a fucking gremlin. And I was constantly told that I just had to put up with it, completely destroying my self confidence to what it is now.
Taking funds from schools, which many are already cash strapped, is a way to bully schools into avoiding this perspective. All curriculum has flaws, but the one with a black perspective is being targeted. That's problematic.
Oh no. Suicide is NOT a choice it is coerced by circumstances. I beg you don't be so disrespectful. Bullyism can be tackled by School authorities - but in 100% of cases, the authorities would punish the weak and the persecuted rather than the bullies.
The bullies in high school won the most popular
I await the day that some fucktard from junior high that bullied me for being weird or "looking like a boy" or for dating a girl pops up to me because NOW I'm more attractive or whatever so I can UNLEASH MY RAGE UPON HIM.
I want to find the correlation between girls who bullied me in high school and their inevitable careers in nursing
yâ€™all got bullied in high school? lmaoo i wasnt goin for nun of that shit. i was jus there to be high and talk to girls
I'mma hang out with EXO Ls and revluvs, help treasure makers with their h.w, bully akgaes and Blackvelvet antis.... Wow school would have been so fun that way
I wish I didn't waste most of my school life wasting living under constant fear of bullies. Now it feels extremely silly now that i am an adult and i always ask myself this "why i let them ruined my social life, what was i even afraid of" but tbh, its mostly girls in my school
I saw a psa about a new girl in high school sit at lunch with the "in" girls who then got up &amp; left her, and a nice girl then sat down with her. If I could Freaky Friday these bully girls would get their asses beat the minute they stepped off school grounds. Parents need ER bills
Okay scientists, now just teach the rats to play hide and seek in the underwear drawer of the girl who bullied me in high school
I was bullied unmercifully by a nasty girl in elementary school. Saw her at my 40th high school reunion, and she IMMEDIATELY said to me, before I could speak, â€œIâ€™m so sorry. My dad was an alcoholic, and I took my pain out on you.â€ Realizing that helped: it wasnâ€™t anything I did.
I probably wouldâ€™ve bullied gun girl in high school
Just had a customer who used to bully me in high school come in and she looks ROUGH. Basically, donâ€™t be a bully kids
The meanest girls in high school are the ones posting about kindness &amp; positivity now bitch u bullied me for 4 years lmao
A grade school was grouping with his friends to bully a friend who has disability. In the end, those friends of his are hypocrite and he's getting bullied later. It's karma. Later, he tries to make amends and being a better person.
Itâ€™s like when my elementary school bully messaged me telling me all lives mattered and you should be kind to everyone... he left welts-cuts on my arm for weeks in the fourth grade and never stopped bullying me until I left that school in the 8th grade
what this movie represents. This movie isn't reality, this movie isn't relatable. But what this movie is, is what life would be like if there was no hate, if school didn't have bullies, if gays were accepted for loving each other, if race, gender, sexuality etc wasn't 2/3
A girl back in high school jumped in front of a train because she was bullied
the thing that kills me is the same adults who say *oh you're young, be careful on here, ok?" will be the same adults to bully the shit out of you as if they're overgrown middle school children or something.
Which group does #BunkerBoy fantasize about leading? The other group is running low on equipment. Middle school bullies, mean girls and #MAGAts don't fantasize about healing people.
i hate when girls i went to high school with try to sell me stuff on facebook like no iâ€™m not gonna buy your hsn vitamins, you bullied me in math
Letâ€™s not forget ... shoutout to the â€œpopularâ€ girls who bullied me throughout junior high,&amp; compared titties with each other the locker room I ainâ€™t forget that #lastnightasawarrior
Funny how so many girls are posting suicide awareness stuff on insta but they bullied tf out of people in high school
These are the same wack songs the girls from my high school listen to and think theyâ€™re altnevative but bullied me middle school! Luv yâ€™all I donâ€™t forget!
He showed some nice upside in some ways in college, especially with his build. But honestly I think he was sooo dominant in high school that it heavily inflated his draft stock despite major limitations. There was no way heâ€™d thrive at bully ball on offense in the NBA as a 6-6 SF
1000 Doves doesnâ€™t deserve any of the hate it gets yall just like to bully youre all high school bullies
For what it's worth, Barr reminds me of an ancient rock formation in Goblin Valley. The school yard bully can be toppled.
Wedding vows of the girl who bullied you in high school. Watch the full video here: https://bit.ly/30bj30x
I cannot wait to go back 2 school i am going to bully the shit out of transphobes &lt;3
Large group of young foot soldiers being schooled in how to disrupt speakers corner picking on someone who the police will do little/nothing to protect. School playground bully tactics from those who now have the protection of the establishment.
We talk a lot about bullying in our schools. Well let me tell you that in this matter the biggest bully right now is the School Board and the senior administration, Peterson said during Wednesday's Board meeting.
Lol bc I just found this throwback picture and my elementary school bully really used to bully me for being fat (caused me so many body image issues) and this bitch was bigger than I was. How tf? I need a redo. Lemme go back and slap some sense into her
His high school girlfriend is one of the most ignorant people I've ever met, as well as his most Dubai-ian friend. They're bullies. Cam would be extremely confident in himself. I think he'll find a girl in his early 40's
If I was still in school I would have loved online learning. I was teased and it made it hard to learn. With no bullies around you learning would come easy! Focusing on education rather than peers
Thereâ€™s Tumblr girls, VSCO girls, but are yâ€™all ready for Twitter girls? Qualifications: â€¢ avi is a mirror pic in underwear / lingerie / bikini â€¢ emoji in username â€¢ def bullied you in high school â€¢ has a premium snapchat â€¢ Venmo / PayPal @in her bio â€¢ â€œrelatableâ€
Thanks Rachel & Mike, I remember when my youngest was bullied on the school bus, it broke my heart. I went to the school to talk to the girls involved, told them how they frightened my daughter, they apologized to both of us, and were her friends thru high school.
Laugh at these people, bully them in school and on the street. Show others how little they belong in society.
I'm an Anomaly because I'm a lesbian and came into gay culture with gay men, cross dressers and even transvestites. As a child I fought off male school bullies who went after young gay boys. I didn't know if they were HSTS or just gay but no one else was standing up for them.
Exactly this. PE was the *only* place where my teenage bullies were able to physically assault me and get away with it. I wasn't that bad at sport, but by the time I was 14, I didn't feel safe. I'd had to take days off school due to neck pain, they'd spent 5 mins in time out!
Christine is fucking horrible man. Goes around telling people she was bullied in high school and then starts being a bully in later life #SellingSunset
@duckford10: @Daziley @wilstone3 @djohnsonbear ha classcooor you two are a couple of cunts
feetman absolutely used to venemously bully girls in high school for being weird moshers or whatever, and then pitched a fucking fit when she found a used tampon in her PE kit and grassed everyone within a 5 mile radius to the headteacher.
she votes with her feelings, all the way. she will vote solely based on abortion and prayer in schools. but if they seem like a bully (her words) she will vote for someone "kinder". she saw Sanders that way (and Carter, her only Dem vote). she abstained with W.
How about I go onto your Twitter and harass you for getting to wear the colour pink freely without repercussions because my friend got bullied for wearing pink at school! Even though you werenâ€™t one of the bullies â€” but you do have the same skin colour as them!
1. errrr an irl nickname..? i dont believe i have one but at school i was called repeatedly jaggers and stupid girl
No heâ€™s a COMEDIAN. Bully? smh Child please!! I had worse things said to me in MIDDLE school!
Okay Sardarji! Go through my TL,since u anyway donâ€™t have much else to do,as evident....& youâ€™ll find Iâ€™m neither Right winger nor Left.I call out whatâ€™s wrong. And neither of u two oldies have yet argued anything on point,& are busy trolling like school bullies.Look at urself!
This just reminded me of 2018, when a girl I went to high school with told me she understood what being a black girl in my school must have been like because she also got bullied for being a SAn German
wtf a disease. one time this girl deadass bullied me in high school bc i dyed my hair pink after her friend dyed her hair pink, n my hair wasnâ€™t even anything close to what the other girl did lmaooo
Omg I did it in high school. I got bullied got called the d slur for cutting my hair. But I also inspired other black girls at my school to do the big chop too and go natural. It was hard but I really enjoyed the process and looking back at it.
U look like every basics white girl who whined abt wanting a sassy gay best friend in high school but bullied the lesbians
Ive had girls that bullied me in high school try to add me on facebook and clicking that delete button is soooo satisfying lol
also the Amanda Seales "jealousy" comment sounds a lot like ya'll lightskint girls who swear up and down you was bullied in high school cuz everyone was "jealous" of you. Totally leaving out the part of you being a insufferable bitch all the time.
#YAMonday excerpt from my NA horror short, Infinite Eater, about a bullied high school girl who finally gets the ultimate revenge against her abuser (CW: eating disorders) https://twitter.com/CBethAnderson/status/1211500964659843074
This woman doesn't speak for me and her 'school uniform' analogy is BS. I wore a school uniform and still got bullied, because mine was bought with a grant rather than going to a branded shop. Bullies with find something, uniform or not.
Imagine how bullied a black girl called Felicia gets in High School
Like I said ... let that go. Darkskin girls get bully way more.. yall got bullied in school. They got bullied even when they finish high school. Like I said let that hurt go. GET OVER IT. stop trying in divide the black community.. because you got your feelings hurt.
#NAME?
sadly was the dilemma I faced in teaching middle school. All schools I know of had a rule "you throw, you go." The good kids who wanted to stop the bully did not want, nor did I want them, to get suspended. The bullies did not care...and quite often, sadly, neither did their
Me: Girl who bullied me in high school:
Asked for advice on fb for weight loss for cats from my folks who have cats Middle school bully: stop feeding her so much and get some toys idk Listen Karen sheâ€™s already got seventy million damn toys and food is cut down significantly
I agree. Although male, I could never become fond of sport, once I started PE at school. All my PE teachers were, to a man, dull, boring obsessives, assholes and bullies. Put me off for life. I watch some soccer on TV, thatâ€™s it.
*heavily bullied in high school* Now Iâ€™m 21, already a college graduate with pink hair, multiple tattoos/ piercings, and a darling bf... guess what? Your girl is ALSO in a PhD program and will be Dr. Wicker soon! Thanks bullies! I am living my absolute BEST life
this girl who bullied me in middle/high school just Dmâ€™d me on Linkedin to talk business. do I tell her that I fucked her current man before her and that sheâ€™s low key a bitch? or do I just be nice ?
Iâ€™m so sorry that you were mistreated and bullied. We will miss you a lot angel. Fly high beautiful girl #Sulli
them high schools bullies on movies hit different. Ugh, pisses me off
girls who bullied me in high school are hufflepuffs now and im garden gnome
AG Barr is a Racist! Jimmy Lohman, who overlapped with Barr &later Columbia University, wrote a piece Florida Flambeau newspaper about Barr being â€œmy very own high-school tormentorâ€a â€œclassic bullyâ€ and â€œpower abuserâ€ in 1960s who â€œput the crunch on me every chance [he] got.â€ RT
One of the girls who bullied me in high school told me I was not cool because I wasnâ€™t a â€œmodelâ€ like her after she did the mall modeling crap
Trump is like the sixth grade school yard bully. Tries to undermine and intimidate anyone he can.
all throughout my years of high school i have never seen a tall girl get bullied lmaooo what is they on
Yo that does not sound like a fun group of people to be around.. at all.. ever. Fuck that. Sounds like the generic blond girl villain in every tv show about a high school kid that gets bullied.
if me and season one hinata went to the same high school i would bully him
All those nasty bitches sitting in Kyleâ€™s room like theyâ€™re teens at their high school friends sleepover bitchin about the pretty girl theyâ€™re jealous of. Theyâ€™re all sitting there pretending to believe Brandiâ€™s bullshit so they have a reason to hate and bully Denise. #RHOBH
Getting bullied online is tough I remember one time this girl in high school bullied me on Tumblr everyday because I was a weird virgin and didn't want to have sex with her she came on too strong smdhhh I deserve it now tho
Yâ€™all this is my last week of school and i have so much work to do to actually be able to graduate. If you see me on twitter in daylight hours PLEASE BULLY ME OFF THIS APP
it seems that the bullies are the ones insisting that kids go to school when cases are raging. You realize that we are in a code RED state right now that other states have put on a banned list? Do you realize how many teachers are refusing to go? Who's going to teach them?
Joe Rogan Episode #5434 Your Bully in High School
better days (2019) dir. kwok cheung tsang â€” chinese | drama | crime â€” a bullied high school student and a small-time criminal become the prime suspects in the murder of a teenage girl who turns out to be the student's nemesis for the state Gaokao exam.

I didnâ€™t get bullied in high school for dating a girl just for some people from my school to use pride as an aesthetic,,, fuck off
Oh god where do I start. I had buck teeth, spent almost ten years being called â€œRabbitâ€ and was also bullied for being fat. When I got to high school, I was bullied for not wearing makeup, so I was known as the ugly girl who never said anything. Also being bi didnt help either...
Blocking my middle school bully and also the root of the majority of my mental problems is self help right
girl from my high school whom i bullied to and haven't spoken to once in 7 years: *gets married* me: she didn't invite me to the wedding? what a cunt!
i remember when i was 12 people @school used to bully me because i loved one direction &amp; im a black fan &amp; they claimed i donâ€™t belong there because theyâ€™re white (the boys) &amp; they make music for white people only &amp; if i kept listening to them that means iâ€™m not a real black girl
president trump reminds me of the school bullys use to pick on me in school and now he gets to bully the entire country. its not right but it will end in november when @JoeBiden wins so everyone please vote #Biden2020
Oh please, donâ€™t martyr yourself. You acted like a school yard bully. Iâ€™m not buying the victim role! You get what you wish. Period.
Yet theyâ€™ll receive a good portion of that !$105B and if the the government spent $5B of that on installing virus defeating technology systems ( yes they do exist) in schools theyâ€™d be totally sterile, teachers would have no excuses and weâ€™d save $100B
A senior at my high school slept with a trans girl and he got bullied so hard he had to transfer schools to another state and I think he changed his last name.
Itâ€™s the exact same writing as every girl who bullied people in high school and now runs a handmade candle business
As a 6â€™2â€™â€™ tall woman, seeing that Netflix movie about a tall girl in high school getting bullied is just unrealistic??? I got maybe a few backhanded remarks a handful of times. Also the whole idea that she needs a makeover to be seen as attractive as a girl over 6â€™0â€™â€™.....BAD!!!
big high school BULLIES!!!!
I just found out that the girl who bullied me so much in high school has an insta all about mental health and idk if I should laugh or cry or both
a little piece of me is happy the bullies from my high school never made it to the nhl

Bunch of bullies playing war. Itâ€™s like someone finally gave them the approval to go be the tough guy that they werenâ€™t in high school.
I love seeing other girls who post â€œgirls support girlsâ€ but they literally bullied me through high school and after okay thatâ€™s a lie botch
I read once that all girls are bullied and are bullies in high school. and it did feel like no girls were ever just nice to each other. So itâ€™s not easy to find. Girls at that age are insidious!!
The only way I could finally get one of my bullies off my back in high school was to turn around and knock him over. He knew how to torment me out of sight, but the day I finally fought back, he never saw it coming. To his little band of followers, it brought him down a peg.
roast beef and this girl definitely bullied me in high school for being gay
#SeniorsHigh a 1/2 hour dramedy which shows that from high school to old folks home, thereâ€™ll always be cliques, bullies, drama, love and practical jokes. Because growing old doesnâ€™t mean growing up.
I just got a girl pregnant in high school, so I told my parents I was being bullied and we moved lol
I only have one vivid memory of being bullied in high school I came back from the doctors from having my heart checked for all these disease and I was genuinely scared and at lunch a girl told me she was gonna push me down the stairs To this day idk why she said that
I started highschool literally the year the 2007 crash occured...only reason i went to a catholic school is cuz my mom couldnt afford fresh fits 4 me n didnt want niggas 2 bully me LOL...understandable
Kids wouldn't bully me at school if I had a friend like Mr. Higashikata or Mr. Nijimura do... How do I even get one of those friends?
high school girls are the WORST sometimes i got bullied more by them than anyone else
Maybe a story I have may help it make sense. I was bullied unmercifully when I was 10 by a girl, who was in my school and went on to graduate from my high school. She never came to any of the reunionsâ€”until the 40th. At the 40th reunion, she saw me, read my name tag, and (conâ€™d)
No fans because your dear leader ignored intelligence warnings from as early as DECEMBER. He STILL ignores a raging pandemic to golf every damn weekend & he's gonna kill kids, teachers & families as he bullies schools to open to boost his campaign. FU all.
a girl that bullied me in high school came thru the drive thru today kept staring at me????? and i was like:
I donâ€™t have the Facebook app but sometimes I log in just to see if any of the girls who bullied me in high school had a baby with some dude who was popular in highschool but is now just a republican asshole and really do some digging to find out how miserable they are
girls are worst most people are bullied by girls men will just be the sheep and do what there female friends do or if your in high school girl friends. most of the time it is girls picking on girls because for some reson insted of supporting each other we tear eachother down.
Iâ€™ve just seen someone write a status of Be Kind, when they legit bullied me in high school and again in Sixth Form. It just pisses me off so much, that they caused so much pain for me and they have the audacity to say that. Girl bye.
So essentially, COVID is irrelevant to the CDC now. I would like to know on the school side how they are going to control bullies who will purposely cough on a student.
Pompeo's brazen lies and school-yard bully behavior make him the worst SecState in living memory

Sounds like she was bullied by one black girl in high school and she's still angry. She needs therapy.
I was a fat girl with thick glasses, who didn't give give a darn about sports, high school spirit, fashion, or drama. For me it was four years of hell where I was ostracized, bullied, and picked on. The only saving graces were my choir classes, operetta-musical theater, 1/2
i just witnessed some girl get bullied on her first day at royale high- she left but i think she either disconnected or the bullies got to her. it was super sad tho
I nearly got suspended for standing up to a girl who had bullied me for years in high school the gurl ran to her parents and got attention just because they were rich i had reported previously and got no attention at all
The governor of SC, Henry McMasters, has been trying to do away with SC citizens also. He has done absolutely nothing to protect us.We have been in our own since the beginning.He had Pence & DeVos here this week trying to bully the unsafe schools open. Virus #are bad &amp; climbing.

School Shooters are the biggest cowards on the earth Everyone goes through bullying at one point in their life, it sucks but it's true. But if you bring a weapon to school with the intent to harm or kill, your no good than the cowards that bully you. And that's a fact.
The tall girls at my high school weren't bullied, in fact they were popular
Nah, not even themselves. They just feel good if they can exercise power. Meaning, logic, intent, reason are not really needed. As long they can f your sh_t up and get to grand stand over you like a school yard bully, they are happy and content. They are the worst kind of trash
@Dahlia_Sin reminds the girl who bullied me in high school but it would secretly turn me on.

i left school due to mental health (nothing to do with bullies/other students) and did homeschooling, it was the best decision. my mom/therapists/etc were SUPER against it and they made me go back my final year of high school, ended up not being able to finish
Trump's supporters are all the bullies we had in high school who never amounted to anything and now they want to blame everyone but themselves.

Watching Tucker without sound brings up a lot of bad memories of high school bullies.
Watching Tall Girl. I went in with really high expectations but already Iâ€™m like????? Iâ€™m not doubting tall girls get bullied. But really? â€œHowâ€™s the weather up there?â€ THAT many times before FIRST period? Also sheâ€™s only 6 foot 1. Why is the dad acting like she could die?

I think Biden should refuse to debate trump. Whatâ€™s the point? Heâ€™s just going to lie and try to bully him. Operation Less Is More is working great for Biden. Letâ€™s keep it going. Just make Trump seethe when he refuses to meet him in the parking lot after school.
HIGH SCHOOL. FUCKING. BULLIES.
Iâ€™m so glad I can comfortably talk about being a horse girl again without being bullied like in high school

nice to see school bullies are still.... bullies
not to be dramatic or anything but if billie and i went to the same school, i'd willingly let her bully the living shit out of me
Im a guy and I would be chastised and bullied for refusing to participate in treating girls like this because not participating in this harassment meant I was surely gay, this was in middle and high school so it definitely happens. Believe women when they tell you their stories.
@Mark_Sanchez I almost forgot that you dated a high school girl from Connecticut two years ago. That's how much of a loser you are.
girls who bullied me in high school are imaginations now and im high
He wasnâ€™t the school bully...he was the wimp the bullies beat up on.
Thinking about when a girl in high school bullied me for being gay and I had gang members jump her on my behalf.... My mind
Girls from high school who owned this shirt are finally realizing why they got bullied all four years
For years, the ATA has been promoting anti-bullying programs in their schools, whilst simultaneously using bully tactics on the political playground, demanding more and more taxdollars, yet producing an ever declining quality of education for kids. The hypocrisy is unbearable.
Former high school bullies find their moment under Cuccinelli. Frightened little boys lash out...because Daddy told them to. Whatâ€™s troubling about this activity is not all protesters are actually protesting. Right wing nuts have infiltrated the protests to damage property.
School Bullies Don't Stand A Chance Against This https://youtu.be/JT5abjOg23Y via @YouTube

Meet Aksuna, Coren's school bully turn boyfriend. His breath smells worse than her diapers. Don't stare into his eyes too long or you'll wake up a week later in a dumpster in Detroit, wearing nothing but a tutu and a diaper, with no keys, phone, and a craving for expired dogfood.
Why him Just.. Why did he have to bother him?! He hadnâ€™t even reached the school yet!! He flinched at the tight grip on his arm pulling him closer towards one of the schoolâ€™s many bullies. Though this one seemed to have a fixation on his older brother, creepy. -
I despise bullies and transphobes but shooting up a school won't do anything good.
100% Bin Ladenâ€™s like those kids at school who bully people on Facebook and then donâ€™t come into school the next day
I have a way smaller friend group and to be honest it's been years and it was exhausting.The drama,the upkeep I'm not a high maintenance girl I felt bullied when my nail color was off.I have kitty cat pajamas on and am just chilling #Happiness
Reading this I got the image of a school bully desperately trying to lure/provoke the smart kid into a fight because that's the only way it could defeat m. US is increasingly starting to look like the school bully: no brains only muscles
He thinks he's immune. He got away with this crap before when he covered for ollie north. He's brazen because no consequences have ever been applied to him. He's pushed his agenda since high school. He's a bully in a white man's world.
confronting the primary school bully and then breaking his arm with my pencilcase

I should seek help because I donâ€™t want other people to get sick? Wow, donâ€™t ever accuse Democrats of being full of hate when youâ€™re this awful. I bet you bullied other girls in high school, too
Middle school bullies are running the Leg and our province
some girl came into my work and said â€œoh my god i think one of u bullied me in high schoolâ€
Great article. I've read a few replies to City tweets lately and seen sneering remarks to 'Bantams Family' and 'happy clappers'. Think I've managed to block or mute the worst culprits. Sadly, think most will never change their ways. Were probably hateful bullies at school too.
Damn I'll be out of high school by then. Be 18, be a little happier than now.
I hope the school is going to put most of that money to use via scholarships. Stop having students take out unnecessary loans for their education. HBCU

...people will just be encouraging stupidity in this country! I tire! If the boy was wrong, charge him and get a court sentence, not bully him like this is a glorified secondary school. I swear, most of our leaders and people in authority are so childish!
This reminds me of a school yard bully session. Pick on the weak kid. The one already beat down. The easy target. One that can easily be crushed.

The Envy of Idols: A High School Bully Romance (Rich Boys of Burberry Prep Book 3)
Being fat, wearing glasses, liking games and anime In high school, wearing glasses, my hair earned me (are you a guy or a girl), got bullied more because I wasnâ€™t â€œthankful for the bullying and being noticedâ€
Something about lessons of history and repeating? Itâ€™s similar to school when the only kids that were on the side of the bully were the weak minded ones who couldnâ€™t think for themselves. Is that us?
I GOT THIS TOO! I was bullied relentlessly by this one girl in High School for being an emo, and that's what the school told my parents. It ended in me getting suspended because I threw scissors in self defence when she was coming at me with a chair in English class???
ha verbal abuse from my primary school bully ;-;
So i am supposed to believe that a high school student came on to a college campus and bullied a college student into admitting that he drugged an underage girl and also gave up his stash of drugs?
i hate those girls who bullied you in high school for wearing thrifted clothes and "non-modern / unfashionable" outfits, but now that they went to college they wear the same clothes you wore and they consider it trendy and fashionable.
there was a ukranian girl at my high school who wore juicy couture all the time and bullied ppl. she was seen having sex with a guy on the bleachers. and also set the girls bathroom on fire.
That whole section of twitter is nothing but whites pretending to be black and/or a bunch of mean girls who got bullied in high school and take it out on others on the Internet because theyâ€™re too pussy in real life. They are not â€œgoodâ€ people despite well intentioned ideology.
Actually, two people I went to school with did. Both were my bullies. Vicious mean little people. I turned to Stephen on the bus one day (at 15 years old) and said "You know what, Stephen? You'd make a good cop". I said it with distain, but apparently he thought it career advice.
I take 7 kids from Columbine stand them all in a line add an ak47 a revolver a nine A Mac 11 and that ought to solve the problem of mine And thatâ€™s a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time @killumi50150718
Good one.... I once accused him of being bullied by a girl in high school who wore an Arsenal top then I got suspended..
Yip. School yard bully and to a certain degree all Godly. The Godliness makes it all acceptable.
the same girls that bullied me in middle school &amp; high school for having big hips/butt are asking for my workout routine now...... suck it whores
I was bullied terribly in elementary school. So badly I switched schools. Didnâ€™t help much. That being said, I loved high school. Going to an all girls school was awesome TBH. I was oblivious to popularity. But I hated being a teenager under my parents. Couldnâ€™t wait to get out.

I still think itâ€™s unfair that Bart from Mom Jeans is on this list given that he was aged 14/15 at the time. I was bullied heavily in high school, and given the lack of emotional maturity that children have at that age I certainly donâ€™t hold it against any of my bullies
And today, I had the dream of a school bully of mine, pushing a boy with crutches on the street, where he got hit by a car- I tried to tell people about this, but bc the school bully was much more popular(i dream, and irl) than me, no one believed me. It was... horrible.
i had forgotten about the smartphone app that lets high school girls determine who within their peer group is unfathomably truly evil and should be bullied and murdered into utter submission
Had a dream I was in high school getting bullied by a girl who moved in 7th grade, why?
This is too specific. Sheâ€™s talking about that one girl in jr. high that called her tomato because her skin was blushing and now itâ€™s all dark skin women bullied me girl if you donâ€™t gtfoh
Elementary, for certain. Linguists say Trump's vocabulary is third-grade level. The United States is being run by a grade school bully that strong-arms the smaller kids for lunch money.
all the girls who bullied me in middle/high school grew up UGLY
Impeached Trump is not invincible. We beat him & now he thinks masks are â€œpatrioticâ€, we beat him & he cancelled @GOP convention, we beat him &amp; now he stopped his bullying on opening schools. We put the â€œbullyâ€ in check! Weâ€™ll boot the bully out of @WhiteHouse
Woke up with a heavy heart yaz I'm thinking about how I got bullied in high school for dating a dark skinned girl they called her all sorts of name people were evil back then I wish I could show you her pic what a beautiful woman but I need her to give me the go ahead to upload â€“ at Bloubergstrand
& christine is trying so hard to channel the mean girls that bullied her in high school someone tell this bitch to shut up
I had delayed reactions to bullies/mean teachers and school conflicts in general when I was in grade 1-4..and would instead wake my mother up in the middle of the night to cry to her about all the problems I had during the day
Itâ€™s the social media equivalent of high school girls being horrible bullies, so yes. My guess is itâ€™s the ones who were bullied turning the tables.
just saw a girl who used to bully me in primary school on Tinder she's a lesbian too lol
girl this one bitch from high school who bullied me puts polls asking if people want info on her pyramid scheme exactly where I tap right to scroll through. Itâ€™s fucked me into a convo with her way too many times
I can only say that if we don't engage the "enemy" on their level then they have already won. The aggressor sets the rules and the rules of engagement have been established. Any school kid knows that the only way to get a bully's respect is to beat his ass That applies here
My new favourite hobby is watching the girl who bullied me in high school profiting off stories about her being bullied in high school, very cool!!
(2/2) The MO State Constitution (Art. VI sec 18(c)) prohibits charter counties from exercising any power over the school functions. Will the school boards and school superintendents in St. Louis County stand up to Page the bully?

I shouldn't have bullied him in high school. Now he stole my girl and is ledge trapping me
Oh, honey. You have no fucking CLUE the amount of assholes I've had to knock in the dirt when I had longer more vibrant hair. From high school bullies to abusive family members. Hair is not a determination of who's left standing after a fight.
Girl u can put â€œalways be kindâ€ in ur instagram bio but donâ€™t forget you bullied me in high school
I JUST MATCHED WITH THIS GIRL WHO BULLIED ME IN JR HIGH HELP MEEEEE
i want shawn as my brother, boyfriend, sugar daddy, best friend, cat sitter, bully, schools nerd.
If I ever opened a school, the bullying policy would be out of this world. First of all, students would be pre-screened for bullying behaviors. Then theyâ€™d be automatically expelled the first time they even try to slightly bully someone else.
some of yâ€™all talk about bakugou like he was a mass bully in middle school. yes he was an absolute asshole but he only bullied midoriya, largely because he was quirkless (which obviously isnâ€™t okay) but damn he didnâ€™t bully everyone he layed his eyes on.
@ITV I'm white and nearly 50 but was bullied at school. My ears were too big, I was fat and thick according to the bullies. I rose above it and became a bloody good chef. When are you going to campaign against #bullying in general and not just #blm?
the boys at school used to call me meg to bully me (in reference to family guy) little did they know they were rly calling me meg because I grew up to be a stallion
I was bullied for being an emotional boy. I also almost exclusively made girl friends through high school. Later realized I was gay, which was also something I got bullied for. School sucked. :V
Not to be sad girl already in2020 but as someone whoâ€™s been relentlessly bullied for things like watching anime in middle in high school, it doesnâ€™t compare to how bad ppl give me shit now a days in my big age for liking BTS and itâ€™s honestly just annoying at this point
Why do all the girls who bullied me in high school work at Dutch bros wtf
The Gun and The Bully had my ass STRESSED in middle school.
Got bullied for acne and for drawing breasts. a girl beat me up in gym class over it and then years later felt so bad about it that she bought me gifts every week in high school???
1 or2 -63 yo white woman. Not racist. Schools segregated when I was in 5th grade. Went to school with blacks all thru middle & high school. Was friends with many. Was also bullied and terrorized by one black girl all thru middle school. Me = 98 lbs weakling. Her = 130 big girl.
You really must have been bullied at school, right? That is how and why people go onto attempt to be bullies themselves behind a imaginary wall they have built around themselves in their own homes on the PC Word to the wise, your words only have meaning to you and not me
a random high school girl told me i was pretty at the mall and i think i flinched because i thought i was being bullied so thatâ€™s how i feel about myself
Wishing my Dad the Happiest of Birthdays and a Blessed Year. Thank you for everything youâ€™ve taught me from math, to not missing a day of school, never back down from a bully, Business, the Power of Real Estateâ€¦
Interesting how bullying education in school is based around being the victim and not geared toward preventing being the bully
When people bully another they go for someone weaker than them and probably smaller/younger. Assuming all of ateez were in high school, i'd assume Yunho's brother was already in college if not already had a job as you can see him working in his studio.
wtf why are u being a high school bully
Not this girl who bullied me in high school getting pit for harry
Democrats are a bunch of school yard bullies, if I was Barr I would have walked out of that dog &amp; poney show.
Seeing bullies and pieces of shit in high school continue to be pieces of shit post high school a decade later really warms my heart.
I had a bully in elementary school I remember he was a lot bigger and pushed me in the sand a few times. So i said fck it and just threw sand in his eyes, he cried. It might have been cheap, but it got the job done. He didnâ€™t bully me again. Lmao idk why I brought this up

In other words, do what the rioters want, and they'll be nice to you? I'm guessing you gave a lot of school bullies your lunch money growing up. I say take the handcuffs off the police, let 'em kick some Antifa/BLM ass, and the problem goes away quick, fast and in a hurry!
My daughter was bullied by the "it" girls in high school, because she was tiny and not 'developed'. She walked the halls with her head down, trying not to get noticed. I fumed. Time has brought redemption, but the hurt still stays. #IStandWithRayden

thankfully walang bully sa school.
u look like a girl that would have bullied me in high school and i say that with all the love and adoration in my heart i think iâ€™m in love with u
We found that most peer victimized adolescents felt less depressed and anxious if they had an emotionally supportive best friend. But, high levels of best friend support seemed to â€œbackfireâ€ for peer victimized girls if they thought their best friend was also bullied. (5/6)
I got bullied really bad for my weight. Everyone in high school was developing all these features and I just never caught up so guys would make fun of me and girls would talk about me. I mean Iâ€™m still little ash but like they niggas like it now so w.e
Four important high school albums. https://twitter.com/hitlerpuncher/status/1287093179192430592
I recognize it because being North Indian, I have wavy, thick hair and when white kids in TX would try to bully me in school, they would always comment on it before calling me gay. Republicans also ran videos of John Edwards combing his hair set to West Side Story. Classy, huh?
I went through all the people who liked the post. Too bad I donâ€™t see a real Man in there, all seem like kids who always got bullied in High School and some ugly girls lol. I feel bad for those people I really do they are just ugly. !! #nosecularism #rightwinger
I got bullied for being feminine and having girl friends, having a high pitch voice, being chubby and for being in musicals/choir and letâ€™s not forget my personal favorite because I wasnâ€™t athletic and acted gay. Itâ€™s taking sometime but I canâ€™t let the haters keep me down.

It's middle school logic. They're hanging with the bully to avoid getting bullied.
This gives me such high school bully vibes.
I want a cut of every girls OnlyFans that bullied me in high school for being a slut
I wish there was a mean bitch in my high school who bullied me and straight up told me not to go for a guy who likes certain features on a girl that I may not have. I donâ€™t care how cute I was in high school, BITCH you shouldâ€™ve told me that...
Ever since then, any complaints I made to my folks didnâ€™t go unattended to. But I became cold. I hated people. I didnâ€™t have friends in high school cos I was like a shark on defense. Even now, I donâ€™t have as much female friends cos I was bullied by mostly girls.
I forgot my snap story wasn't private and one of my high school bullies just watched the entire thing. Ma'am are you fucking lost ?

That girl on the left, was the girl who cried constantly cause she was bullied all throughout high school for being a â€œa scholar from a public schoolâ€ or cause she didnâ€™t speak english that well, yet she chose to grow from that experience. On the right is who she is now. 1/3

I 100% agree. I keep hearing from some parents who are saying â€œIâ€™m not letting the school bully my kid into wearing a mask or social distancing.â€ This just canâ€™t be allowed to continue. We need to protect or teachers and students.
Weird thing about making friends post school, you meet your new friends old friends and realize your new friend would have been one of the girls who bullied you in high school.
I am absolutely FLOORED about this situation. A autistic boy named Korvin can be seen in this video being bullied and harassed by a group of girls at Rowland High School, CA. These girls were to only be suspended for 5 days. FIVE DAYS? they should be expelled. #justiceforkorvin
High school was crazy, being bullied and the girl who bullied me was treated as the victim because her mum was more involved than mine

Just remembered a girl who bullied me incessantly in high school. I remember asking her why the shit she did that some years later and she apologized and told me she just thought I was super cool and she was jealous of me. I still can't comprehend how or why she was jealous.

On the plus side, I learned if you have people laughing, they are less likely to bully you. I remember that happened in high school and I manage to knock everything in the cafeteria over. It was known as wounded swan lake. I see the humour it, like my autism. Iâ€™m unique person.

I should have bullied more girls in high school.
Actually the officer was shining a light in the kid's face. He acted like a high school bully, slapping the phone away. I'm not feeling like these people are even trained to do what they do. Are you? Your militant Randos could leave our cities right now and this would just end.
So in high school I got bullied a lot by this one girl who always tried to say that I was easy and a whore (even tho i hadnâ€™t even had sex yet but besides the point) anyways I always remember this one time she tried to be funny by asking me why I was standing a certain way and
They think they're funny, but it just makes them look like middle school bullies that can't handle their actual work so they're using petty humor as a distraction.
Oh boy, time to go hunt down bullies from primary school and hang their heads over my mantelpiece to restore any honour I've lost through my many fuck ups.

I had this therapist I was forced to see in middle school. I hated her at first. I hated always getting called crazy and stupid as a child, and every adult brought in to "fix" me was either a totally inept dipshit or a cruel sadistic bully. Lydia was different though.
How is he Ranking Member without passing the bar? Heâ€™s so obnoxious & disruptive. Like the big loud-mouthed campus jock in high school no one can stand. Heâ€™s a jackal &amp; a bully who thinks heâ€™s entitled. I canâ€™t wait for his comeuppance. It will be glorious. VOTE JIM JORDAN OUT!!

This woman is delusional. I watched the whole freaking thing and Barr was the one the dems weâ€™re trying to humiliate and bully. Theyâ€™re a bunch of disrespectful goons. NADLER is the head goon and treated Barr like a school kid asking for a restroom break.

if it ainâ€™t a 5 incher and a girl who was probably bullied in high school i DONT WANT IT
How about this for simple, until you have a solution to teach school shooters to avoid negative interactions with their bullies, your clearly poorly-thought out opinion doesnâ€™t hold much weight. Fix your own house before you make suggestion on someone elseâ€™s.
I wish fat women had first dibs on Lizzo tickets tomorrow, not fair that I have to compete with skinny girls who bullied people for being fat in high school, to see my queen

And a small number of us are bullied by our mothers due to THEIR discomfort into comphet. Same goes for all those girls in high school who were raised similarly, and who were rewarded for their natural femininity and heterocentrism. Comphet sucks. -_-

â€œBaseball.â€ She said with a laugh, continuing to walk down the boardwalk. â€œI dabbled in high school. The only girl on the baseball team.â€ She chuckled. â€œAnd before you ask, yes, I was bullied for it. Hard. But I battled through it.â€ She sighed, gazing up at the Ferris wheel andâ€”
She looks like hot badass queen in school where everybody thinks she's bully but then she's a student council president and top student
The girl who bullied you in high school calls herself an empath now.
This is a skill I have never had (or possibly it was drummed out of me in elementary school by bullies). My default reaction to someone coming at me angry is "what did I do wrong?"
he was relentlessly bullied and made misable by transphobic bullies at school and he targeted them in a an attack with his fellow queer classmate Devon Erickson.
This girl who bullied me in Middle/High School and supported Autism Spe*ks is having a baby with her husband (also crap) and it really served as a reminder of how if you're not ready to have an autistic kid your not ready to have kids at all and tbh I'm so scared for their child

A magical journey and a bully turned hero!? This middle school teacher is sold! #SFFpit #MG
Weird. Iâ€™m watching a Law & Order about a high school girl getting bullied &amp; harassed online. So fitting
I was bullied pretty hard before high school. Girls bully by isolating you and crushing your self worth. When I started high school I had zero friends left.
oh letâ€™s add too that blaine DATES KURTS HIGH SCHOOL BULLY! how the FUCK do you like him more than kurt

My middle school bullies on Facebook: â€œI am passionate about mental health â€ Bitch imma fuck you up
Luca - I know it may feel like a solution to change school but it usually isnâ€™t. These horrible people are the ones with the problem and any school which says they donâ€™t have bullying, is lying. I wish we had a magic wand to make these bullies into nice people but it takes time.
That certainly is the fix. It works both ways whatever marginal benefit there is for being light skinned you certain can be be bullied for it also. My sister was light skinned and pretty much almost dropped out of high school from being bullied by dark skinned girls. We got to...
There's a special place in hell for teachers who bully their students (from elementary to high school to university) and women who try to keep other women down Good on you for reaching out to other faculty for support and review
PERIODT! Having to find out that one of my sisters got bullied because the girls in her classroom don't like how she speaks English all the time. The audacity of some high schooler are just disgusting.

Miyano is known to be the school bully. Heâ€™s also apart of the Yakuza. Which is a japanese gang known for their ruthlessness. He was mad and wanted revenge.
i also do, in fact, remember high school, where i distanced myself from the popular theatre girls &amp; they ended up writing in my yearbook at the end of the year that they all had girl crushes on me bc i was the â€œcool gamer girl.â€ i also remember being bullied. both can exist at -
Like Iâ€™m trans & uncomfy with it NOW. In high school 9 years ago I was depressed, closeted, self hating, &amp; overall annoying in my opinion. Iâ€™d hate me then . I used terms like â€œhe-sheâ€ to my friends. I BULLIED a, now fellow T*Girl classmate, that hits on me on Grindr now.
best video game soundtrack of last year is from hypnospace outlaw, a game set in 1999 where you visit angelfire-like blogs, including one that riffs on ishkurâ€™s guide. also notable is a high school bullyâ€™s page where you hear this linkin park-like song.
girls who bullied me in high school are either a part of christian twitter and tweeting bibles verses or a part of cherry emoji twitter and tweeting pics of themselves licking knives there is no in between
if we're really on the "school shootings are ok if i'm an impotent little fag who wishes they did the same to my bullies" wave then aight i guess
she really looks like a high school bully im crying
Let me simplify it for the incompetent. Your kid goes to school and gets bullied and ends up getting punched by the bully. Your kid defends himself and beats the bully up. Your kid gets suspended and the bully gets written up, how would you feel?
MY ART SUCKS AND YOURE ALL LIARS!!!!!!!!!!!!! HIGH SCHOOL BULLIES
Iâ€™m the hot girl who bullied little bitches like you in high school. Iâ€™m so good at putting men in their place, I donâ€™t even have to say a single word to do it. You already feel my power. - findom femdom finsub cashslave -

Crazy how people that use to be bullied in school turned out to be full blown dumbass bullies themselves when they become adults
happy birthday to my middle school bully i still and will forever hate u
The e-boy /e-girl tic toks are admittedly cringey, yes.But if weâ€™re being honest with ourselves they are no older than 18-19. Most of my Twitter mutuals are ADULTS. No one cares that you were bullied in high school for doing xyz, the e-boys/girls werenâ€™t the ones bullying you??
the girl that bullied you in high school now runs a twitter account where she posts completely unfounded inflammatory lies about internet content creators and her opinion is taken just as seriously by the masses as someone who actually did their fucking research. fuck that
I need to explain why I cut myself in that one photo. I was bullied in high school by some girl who hated me for being white and catholic. Sheâ€™d push me, call me names and recently she prank called me saying The exact same stuff. (1/??)
A silent voice. itâ€™s about this guy who bullied this deaf girl in middle school and made fun of her for using sign language then later on in high school or college I canâ€™t remember, he actually learned sign language and finds her and itâ€™s so sad n cute

why does mayonaise talk like the white girls who bullied me in high school and went into health care becasue they "care about people and want to help"
My 8th grade English teacher told my mom I needed to be enrolled to an all girls high school because I was distracted in class because of boys. Sir, I was bullied everyday but ok
How does every day get worse? Remember the unchecked narcissistic sociopathic bullies from grade school? Well, they grew up, and their daddyâ€™s put them in power. And now we get to live in a world led by unchecked narcissistic sociopathic bullies.
at least art school gave me these sick graphic design skills so I can bully politicians online with gay edits
Not to throw all bi people under the bus but there also seems to be a pretty strong connection between girls who identify as bi now and the girls that bullied me mercilessly in high school for â€˜looking and acting like a lesbianâ€™
And then the things that keluaq from my mouth has some weights in it. That shouldn't be burdened a young child lah. And the things repeated again. The truth that i told has make other people in trouble, but especially to me, which led to all the bullies back in school.
but then Sunday night that stress hits like a school yard bully.
My name was made by bullied, I couldn't afford clothes in high school and I was growing out of them and so a girl started calling me tightkidd and got the school to call me that, it went on for 3 years. Then I got myself an Xbox and I decided to use TightKidd as my gamertag
I feel bad, I don't remember his name, but there was this retarded man in my school, and he didn't fuck with no one, but people fucked with him, and that's when I got my case of the ass. he did nothing wrong, and I defended him from bullies.
also i was such an outcast in high school - i never felt like i fit in with the other girls cause i wasn't at all interested in the same things they were (boys, traditional "girly" things), and i was bullied very badly in 9th grade bc i didn't fit in and was shy. this seems (6/7)
Schools couldnâ€™t give two fucks about bullying. They expect that the posters work and treat the bully victims like they did all the bullying then when a kid kills themselves because of it they say itâ€™s either phones and such or they â€œreally didnâ€™t see the signsâ€
This is the kind of whore that definitely bullied girls for being emo in high school like hop off the face of the earth
Unpopular Opinion Time: the ones saying that their kids will miss the best times of their lives by missing in-person school even though COVID were the bullies growing up. #YallKnowWhoYouAre
On soul, just my size alone is what I always got bullied about. Even when I got in high school I felt discouraged and insecure on the way I looked, what didnâ€™t make it better is hearing â€œyouâ€™re pretty for a big girlâ€. Til I got older and accepted the way I looked.
It's still a family's name. My family name is Gay. When my kids were bullied and beaten up as a result of prejudice and ignorance, a school principal suggested than giving them my maiden name might stop the bullies. Leave names alone.
Omg so much. I donâ€™t talk about how much I got bullied in school that often because Iâ€™m just not that girl no more but mannnn itâ€™s so much that I felt like I had to fight the entire time I was in elementary/high school. Iâ€™m so grateful itâ€™s over! And I donâ€™t wish that on any kid
Shawty was bullied in high school and now she got 24k on IG. Same girl yâ€™all called a man on this here app Thereâ€™s no balance to life.
I was being bullied in class and asked my teacher if I could call my mom for emotional support. She instead made a joke about me because some reason at Black schools teachers love to bully students. So I wrote her a hate letter
That may pass if you're still in high school as a bully, but this is coming from an elected US Congressman that should be way past that type of loutish behaviour. Ignoring it by just brushing it off as harmless banter is probably why it still exists.
I PROMISE WEâ€™RE NOT ALL LIKE THAT most girls who are like that are white, preppy, bullied ppl in high school and only do it for the money
VBJHDNKDSHBJNK WHY DID I LET MYSELF GET BULLIED BY THIS GIRL IN HIGH SCHOOL SHE'S SO UGLY LMAO
And Peter was more of a bully than the bullies in his school
//It's getting late here. My writing pace is slowly getting better and better. Soon, i should be able to be back at my peak and prime. Goodnight, my dear slut. I shall be back tomorrow(or in 7-8 hours, depending on your timezone.) It makes me so happy to rp again with you all.
they would bully me in high school
They are like overgrown school bullies swaggering around in their gang. They think like johnson they're untouchable, above the law, and fantasists gaslighting everyone. Ive never known such viciousness and im in my 50s! Its terrifying knowing people fall for the lies!
Girl in the braids looks like she's made of pure evil wtf she literally has the face of a typical secondary school bully who manipulates the whole school into emotionally torturing that 1 poor kid who's never done anything to hurt her. R/oddlyspecific
my mom was bullied by this girl in high school and as revenge she decided to take her brother to prom
I'm sure the school bullies from the year above beating the shit out of little Orchid Snapdragon will also think the name is "whimsical".
100% reaks of a guy who got picked on in high school to no end, now wants to go bully high schoolers and try to look like a badass. The irony is, he'll probably just get more shit than ever.
girls who bullied me in high school are imaginations now and im childhood
@CHlLDHOODRUINER: when ur teacher tells u that u have homework https://t.co/RKk5vawIj1 this bitch need to go!!!

THESE ARE HIGH SCHOOL BULLIES
Calling yourself â€œoutspokenâ€ is just another way to say â€œyeah I was a bully in high school and I have no other personality traits to excuse that so Iâ€™m just going to continue to be a grown ass adult bullyâ€ #BachelorinParadiseAU
Then as I went through high school I got bullied for being pretty . I was NOT popular because I was so very shy. I'd have the football players or older guys hit on me. Popular girls HATED that because I was a nerd and never talked. I hated it too. Leave. Me. Alone. Everybody.
When I was a high school freshman this boy used to leave closed mousetraps on my desk and I think about that a lot because it seems like open mousetraps that could snap on me would be more effective as a bullying tool? Anyway at our reunion Iâ€™m gonna give him bully advice.
At this point beyond a handful of exceptions, Republicans are just the little kid at school, getting bullied and giving away his lunch money. It only ever stops when you snap and punch the bully in the mouth and go full ralphie on them.
Why do you care about followers, do people at school bully you that much?
School is full of bullies and over worked and under paid teachers, and now weâ€™ll force them to risk their lives and be responsible for the proper hygiene of all the kids!
Just admit you want to live out you high school bully fantasy and leave me the hell alone.
remember when girls in high school bullied me over tweeter for trolling and calling myself a queen over and over yoooooo why were they sâ€™ mad

They went to my school. Yâ€™all are bullies fr
Mind blown: Today I found out that the girl who bullied me throughout high school is hella gay now. And I havenâ€™t stopped laughing about it. Well, hello little stereotype.

Hi cuz Tracey me ur cuz Yvonne just be careful on Twitter who u really talk to just be safe got bullied in Marsden state high school in Brisbane got bullied by mainboys and maingirls since my high school in Brisbane nobody even like me including got bullied this girl
Oh goodness. Being a whore, being a bitch, being friends with the guys. I slept with 3 people in high school. All boyfriends at the time; 2 were long term. I was a bitch because I was bullied by some very sad girls. Lastly, I was friends with the guys because girls were cunts.
I was bullied through middle school and half way into high school. You know what stops bullies? A couple good bloody noses.
I know for a fact Doja got bullied in high school or was the black girl who just wasnâ€™t black enough. I love her though. She got a different music vibe
I left them but they always be coming at me. It's like a situation where u have been ashamed in the whole school and everyone knows about it.Everyone are just bullies, fakes, and they hate you. Sometimes I don't care, but sometimes it comes to me that I have been alone forever.
My big sibling was terrified to exist within the locker room at our high school because the other girls bullied them for the way they looked when they were naked. If their parents properly and accurately educated folks about gender identity and bodies of all types...
When my friend was teasing me about being weak, I grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and pinned him against the lockers like some 80's TV high school bully.
my elementary school bully just sent me a friend request on facebook
i was thinking about how i bullied a girl in jr high or high school and i think it really was just an excuse to talk to her or initiate physical contact, like one time i was sitting behind her and got a rubber band tangled up in her hair yet i insisted that she let me remove it
name calling = one of the worst forms of bullying i was bullied a lot in elementary &amp; high school by 1 group of girls. they mocked my nicknames. i was "tissue" &amp; "tooshie" as sounded so close to tashie &amp; tasha. it may sounds funny to you, but shit like this you never forget.
as the 26 year old woman who's been under 5 ft her whole life, who has known girls 6+ ft who got bullied in middle/early high school.....they dont need to be a "discriminated group" in like all of America personally I wouldve loved a movie like this when I was 12/13
You've described the Bully Vaccum. Parents who eschew discipline and conflict have had an "instructional safety net" in schools and playgrounds with The Bully; a figure that teaches consequences and the general rule that life isn't fair. Anti-bullying campaigns are destructive.
People used to think I was a quiet, standoffish child because I was 'bitchy'. No. I wanted to be introverted and talk to everyone, but I was horribly abused if I made the slightest peep at home, and every time I started having fun in school, the bullies reminded me how ugly I was
And recreate it and not get the same hate that black girls got in elementary, middle and high school. Donâ€™t be blind to that fact that a lot of black girls were bullied bc of their â€œbig lipsâ€, skin color, fashion, hair etc.
Morgan gave me girl who used to bully you in high school then hits you up with a â€œhey girly â€ and then tries to get you to join her pyramid scheme for flat tummy teas
Well thatâ€™s school for ya. A real crappy experience. Itâ€™s a gamble if youâ€™re gonna meet good people or just meet a bunch of bullies who disguise themselves as your friend.
Cant believe they bullied rebecca black out of school!! she is only human she doesn't deserve hate!! :| leave the poor girl alone!
every girl that bullied me in middle and high school wore viva la juicy perfume and thats a fact

I went to an all girl's school and was bullied every day. In high school it stopped because they realised I had talents and the school was a better place with me in it.

He also caused a kid to drop out of high school and made another girl a scapegoat for all of his problems. I feel for the kid that was bullied and tormented...but that ends the day he brings a gun to school.
@LBC My daughter was bullied by a black girl in high school last year. The black girl was expelled. Her parents then went to our local mp accusing the school of racism. She is now back at my daughter's school. Nothing to do with racism, the bully just happened to be black.
Be like high school student wey dem de bully
We all knew the type as kids. Utterly cowardly and insecure, but when teamed up with the school bully, instantly becomes â€œtoughâ€ and cruel.
i posted a tiktok that included a pic of my elementary school bully, and someone who goes to his highschool (aka the one i would've gone to) liked it, but i didn't even know her. i stg if more people from that school find my tiktok-
a few months ago i was pinkertoning with the windows down in my car and i made eye contact with a girl who bullied me in high school
I find it mildly hilarious that the same girls who bullied me when I was a freshman in high school while they were juniors and seniors are always the first to like my pictures. Fans
My high school head teacher belittled one of my friends and dragged her in the girls toilets and scrubbed her makeup off because it was different. She was bullied all through school and the head teacher done nothing. My friend killed herself later on down the line...
Just curious, if your kids want to bully other kids at school, how much would you support their freedom?
No, I hated it. LOL! I was bullied throughout high school, by other black girls.
in middle school i was the only black girl so people would pick on me until i dragged a girl down the stairs and they stopped. in high school i wasnâ€™t bullied but one bitch called me fat on askfm lmfao

ARE YOU TELLING ME ALL THOSE CALLOUT POSTS ARE CAUSE HES A HIGH SCHOOL BULLY AND NOT BECAUSE HE KILLED SOMEONE WITH A VOLLEYBALL
More than once in middle school, I saw a kid getting bullied in the bus and inserted myself to tell the bullies to leave them alone.
We had a student teacher PE coach our senior year of HS who worked at the middle school (where the teachers are known the bully unathletic kids) and he told us how one gym teacher told him that they purposely single out unathletic kids and get kids riled up at them
True. I miss the days when all I ever have to worry about is passing my tests & quizzes. Adulting is a whole new level of school, with harder tasks to perform without fail, and with occational meaner bullies along the way @BTS_twt
this girl i went to high school w has grown to be so aggressively similar to me that like we could have been such amazing friends?? its a shame she bullied the shit out of me hhh
if bad's actual name is nonathan ima throw hands bc that's the same name as the kid that used to bully me for like 4 years on elementary school and no i will not calm down
After Ryan graduated boarding school, he became a Prefect so he could stick around and protect his brother while he was still studying, as Flynn often had troubles with bullies (such as Brandon, a particularly nasty one who often used to make Flynn's life a living hell).
i'm in the McDonalds drive thru and I look over to the window and sitting inside is this girl who used to get bullied so much in High School and she's sitting their so happy next to her boyfriend and honestly it was the sweetest thing
Every single one is a girl that would have bullied me in high school.
Government must not allow COSAS and other unions to bully them. It's not good gir its international image. We send our children to private schools for a reason. I have never received any subsidy from these unions so why should they have a say in my child's schooling schedule.
The conduct bar for Trump appears to be the same as that of a mean-spirited, petty elementary school bully. Makes sense since that probably all he could muster. #NotMyPresident #Vote2020
A girl who bullied me for about 5 years through high school just messaged me to ask me to like and share her business page. Erm how about no??
Genuinely curious why anyone would stan Juno. She's literally the girl who would have bullied you in high school and talked shit behind your back. Absolute trash person. #BEASTARS
I was there by the time I was 11. Middle school and high school were a breeze for me. People tried to bully me by tossing insults, but I just didn't care...which pissed them off.
It's almost like that whole school of arguments was a bad faith attempt to bully the left into supporting a candidate who doesn't share their values
this boy that bullies me is going to the same school as me:( wish me luck
This is why you don't bully nerds in school - one day they'll grow up and try to kill everyone.
not the girl who bullied me in high school reaching out and telling me she â€œmisses our friendshipâ€ and that she is â€œsorry if she ever hurt meâ€ and â€œnever meant to hurt me and thinks of me fondlyâ€ like this yt girl didnâ€™t go around telling people not to be friends with me
Itâ€™s funny how this girl bullied me all through middle school/high school and she sees me and tries to bully me more!! Like baby girl you donâ€™t want this one bc I have changed and I will snap back! And then say I still look ugly like I did back then,my glow up is real sweetheart!
Eve was literally moments away from completing her possession of her hot, manipulative bully from school Mia - when her Mom walked into the room and disrupted the ritual seconds before completion. "Ohhh - too bad loser. This could have been yours, now I'm gonna bully you more."
I was bullied at high school and middle school, plus those girls sat me up. They called out the guys who were like 18 and 16 they said bad shit to them and because I was their friend they ran away as soon as the guys came and left me alone. They beat the shit out of me so......
Woaaah. My high school bullies wonâ€™t know what hit them when Iâ€™m walking around with a pair of these bad boys
girls who bullied me in high school are milks now and im poetry
@JoeyRichter played: - A high school student who is clearly bullied - A sleezeball whose favourite thing is screwing around with a married woman - A man in the stone age who invented painting and wants to be loved - A bisexual criminal whose main purpose is marrying a 15 y/o girl
Haha just realized that my high school bully keeps seeing my tweets when in all honesty i forgot he existed to begin with. .
Or in other words girls in #MAGA households are treated like shitt. Then again the boys are bullied by insecure dads - like diaper jr.
He was Billie Barr, a bully in grade school, who bullied Jewish kids. No joke.

Quiet girl named Mei, she attends high school and has no friends, bullied. A popular guy takes interest in her when his friend trips her in the hall, he tries to start talking to her but she refuses and runs away a lot. Basically he starts trying to change her for the better.

Everyone agrees that the playground bully in grade school is *always wrong*. But once everyone gets a bit older, so few are brave enough to stand up to the bullies in our Culture today, even though they are still *always wrong*. The loudest, most violent &amp; aggressive-&gt; THE LEFT.
Bingo. And deliberately obstrufucated to try to make herself look hip, slick and cool at your expense. (I donâ€™t naturally speak â€œMean Girl.â€ I learned it when my daughter was bullied in junior high.)
I've known for a long time that these same 'cops', were the biggest bullies in grade school &amp; high school. They would beat their victims to a pulp, but always seemed to get away with it. Being a cop is just a continuation of how horrible bullies they were as kids #TrumpGestapo
idk how i feel about a bunch of animeâ€™s going to netflix bc i donâ€™t want my middle school bully to know who kageyama is..
My mom was in a wheelchair. My dad was 6' 4". Funny thing was, they both needed accommodations. My mom just needed more. And tall girls get bullied in high school.
You are what women have been fighting for decades. Body-shaming anyone is being a grade-school bully
The guy who tried to bully me in high school for being gay just got engaged to his girlfriend and then showed up on my Grindr 2 hours later
Movie is a high school drama about HandUnit and his trouble fitting in. After being bullied, he blows them up with his laser eyes. Then a sweet young girl then falls in love with HandUnit and the begin dating. You may be wondering who he is dating. Her name, is Exotic Butters.
I want to tell the 10-year-old girl who was bullied and ostracized because of her choice of music to look forward because one day those who you started loving in your junior year of high school in 2013 would take over the world and change how we think of music. #Shadow @BTS_twt
Seems you're basing your opinion off personal experience too, then. Suffice it to say we have had different experiences. Never was removed from my home, but beating a bully into the hospital served to keep him from bullying anyone at that school ever again. We disagree.
Except... I wasnâ€™t a mean girl in high school. I was habitually bullied by the mean girls and Iâ€™m a nurse... soooo
The killer appears to maintain a shrine of the girl (Jenny Duke) who committed suicide from these kidsâ€™ high school. I'm guessing the killer is Mr. Duke and these kids bullied her or something.
the anxiety of being separated into boys and girls in high school during PE was INTENSE because i was so scared of straight boys due to being bullied from time to time. i had no actual male friends and i was always miserable when this happened.
Why is it so difficult for people of different castes to intermarry. As far as I know, a girl with a low caste needs to spend a lot of money to marry a man with a high caste, otherwise she will be easily bullied by men. What is the caste of your wife?
Every single one of their stories dealing with hate from Star Wars fans has been so sad and just disgusting (though I think Jakeâ€™s was more bullies from school). Sometimes I wonder how great of an actor Hayden couldâ€™ve been if not for him practically leaving Hollywood after ROTS
i hope y'all bully jiyaad back for the way he bullied y'all in primary school
i got a girl pregnant in high school so i told my parents i was getting bullied &amp; we moved..

i had a fcking panic attack as i stumbled on the profile of the girl who bullied me throughout high school...you'd think after more than 5 years it wouldn't have that kind of affect on me
Are we role playing as the girls who bullied us in high school
4. bullies from school, self explanatory.

i graduated high school with one detention for forgetting to do my homework once but apparently i could have used racial slurs, bullied a girl in the bathroom and bullied students with disabilities and left with a clean record.
How did this witch ever get elected? Why does she think every word from her mouth is memorable? To me she seems like a high school dropout who believes she is â€œsmartâ€ like the gossipy clique members who bullied all the other girls. Best to ignore her.
I saw Tubes when I was in junior high. A random tube spoke to my Dad and bullied him into starting the show by getting the audience to cheer until they came out. One kissed my playbill upon leaving, which I later cut out and taped it to my binder. Giant girl crush lady boner.
The girl who bullied me the most in high school is now a somewhat famous yoga teacher who has a TED talk. Sheâ€™s still very much full of shit.
I think itâ€™s funny that in HSM Sharpay is supposedly popular but???? Sheâ€™s some girl who DEVOTES her life to high school theater?? Idk about you but thatâ€™s what I call: girl who deserves to be bullied.
My high school bullies are sliding into my dms and I- ha I canâ€™t help but fuck with them
Thanks to my girl that went to high school with ole Sydney. Hereâ€™s a lovely pic of the Homecoming she never went to because she was so bullied. #TheBachelor
teacher what I knew, so I forced myself to raise it. I joined club activities at junior high school and became deputy director. My teammate girls were bullied by the boys and I evacuated them. Then the target became me, and one of them told me in LINE, "You're not human." In
tonight Taylor, the girl who bullied you in high school, is leaving her kids with her husband so she can meet two of her downlines at Applebeeâ€™s and sheâ€™s going to caption a picture of her 2nd cosmo with the hashtag:
i . don't like the stereotype that bullies have little to no knowledge abt religion and teachings of it,, its kind of dumb bc it doesn't matter. people who are well-versed with religion teachings still bully. people who aren't still bully as well. why does it fucking matter???
With me it was Corbyn posing like a little kid standing at the back of bigger bullies in a school playground -Terrorists- the anti Jewish scandal he couldn't lead his own party never mind the country and the clowns he had on his front bench. The Lib Dumbs? What a disaster; her??!
After being bullied on twitter by pretty much all of R*ritan to where the school had to get involved, Mrs. Mass****ni had the audacity to pretty much infer that I wanted negative attention from men...Letâ€™s give it up for R*ritan and their â€œzero tolerance for bulliesâ€ TOTAL BULL
-I'd had a father that was constantly trying to man me up, often violently. -I'd played with girls more than boys, (though mostly because the boys didn't like me. I liked them plenty) -I'd been bullied for being gay all through high school.
If my child is gay, hopefully because gay people are the best. I'll just teach him how to fight so he can drag the bullies in school lmao
this girl that bullied me relentlessly in jr high was at the show last night and just followed me on instagram and tried to reply to my story and i donâ€™t think she even knows who i am
Iâ€™m 33 and itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve been bullied and it was online not to my face 14 plus year in army and not one of my colleagues would knock anyone when they were down. Brother hood. Girls on here attack u then get their friends to unfollow u. High profile bitchyness
His math team understands math when lining their pockets. He cannot keep track of his lies despite a blonde with a big binder. He flunked the make up semester of beauty school. He is a not so subtle con artist, conning only the fearful and angry white supremacists. He is a BULLY
Stand up to the bullies The piece of shit who tried to bully me in school crumbled when I did t back down Think for yourself Question everything Are you sure? Is the best question
Donald always the uninvited bully....trying to divide the public school systems, hoping teachers quit and go to private schools...always the liar hoping to look important and looking for love. You are a mentally unstable person and your Presidency is over..
I get bloody noses a lot, and I can usually feel it a couple of seconds before it drips. On the last day of school (before quarantine) my nose was about to bleed, but before it could. I turn to my very religious bully and say "hail satan" as my nose started to drip. He freaked.
SHE'S 8! "PÃ©rez finished elementary school by 5, middle school by 6 and high school by 8. Now sheâ€™s reportedly in the process of earning two degrees online." 8-Year-Old Girl, Who Was Bullied and Labeled 'Weird,' Has Higher IQ Than Einstein
Exactly, Iâ€™m saying that everyone saying they were bullied in middle and elementary school all girls were â€œtallâ€ for example me who is only 5â€™6 and got called an Amazon freak. I never took It seriously so Iâ€™m not sure why anything before high school was taken to heart
can girls that bullied me in high school PLEASE stop inviting me to their fragrance &amp; beauty raffle groups on facebook
I was bullied all through grade school into high school. One year I moved to another state &amp; was going through my goth period. So I was an easy target. All my bullies were girls too. I called one a bitch then she came back the next day with death threats. 10th grade sucked balls.
Me going to beat up the school bully after he steals my roblox GF
Cornered and frightened in Elementary school with taunts of â€˜show your hornsâ€™. But grateful the bullies came to know me and realize I was a person as were they

not so nervous and Yuxin just shyly smiled at her. "Is Mingyue doing good at school? Does anyone bullies her?" - Keran "She's doing good at school and she's actively participating during discussions. No one's bullying her." - Yuxin "That's good to hear." - Keran
I was badly bullied at school and I went to an all boys school for most of my life so I find it really hard to trust men. I just get on so much better with girls. Going to a co-ed school in high school was one of the best things that happened to me.
Space-club members, Hawk, Matt and Celeste are sucked through a black hole radio to planets suffering problems only our heroes can help them with; inter-galactic bullies, climate crisis and racism. But will they learn how to stop intolerance at their own school? #SFFpit #SF #MG
the same girls who are screaming about body positivity are the same ones that bullied me for being a size 6 in high school
what does my mum gain from being an asshole nobody thinks ur cool u just look like a high school bully
My niece in high school is worried about the bullies in her school. She's convinced they'll be grabbing at masks and breathing on people.
Your attitude and behavior has kind of an Epstein-pedo feel to it. Were you The Bullies in school, or were you always The Bullied? #AngerIssues
i was bullied relentlessly by a specific clique of girls in high school &amp; i just found out that same group of girls posted a video of them using racist slurs on social media and they all just lost their jobs... man i love the way this universe be workin sometimes :â€™)
England: Here's the spelling of all our words. India: Cool! Well take your word for it! England: *Giggles like the public school bully she is*
Very well written, thank you. We should just remember what we were taught at school: stand up for the bullied. It's amazing how quickly bullies retreat and bystanders turn against them if someone starts speaking up.
all the girls (and guys) that bullied me in high school always are posting about how important it is to be kind and shit like u ruined middle school and high school for me but ur preaching abt being kind ???
So apparently a girl I know from high school is running for town council. She was arguably one of the biggest bullies I've ever known. Good luck convincing people you used to harass to vote for you
Whereas Nadineâ€™s acting and physique is very versatile, she can portay a rich bitch mean girl to a bullied high school girl heck i think she can even portray a role of a fetus and still give justice to it!
@henrywinter Yeh but you got bullied at school you fucking rent boy.
Nah, they found a career... A way to funnel that internal hate outward and feel patriotic at the same time Imagine if the school bully had the staff backing him up and even paying him
Ugh - these women remind of the girls that used to bully me in school so they could copy my homework. I was a nerdy white girl, for context.
I bullied them in high school and Iâ€™ll bully them again!!!
every time i make a post about my ED, this girl makes some shit up about her "eating disorder" a few days later. we went to high school together sis, nobody bullied u for being "fat." ur built like a string bean stop faking mental illnesses for clout!!!!
I guess you're right. I mean, why even bother writing a super emotional story about a kid in high school trying to atone for the way he treated and bullied a deaf girl in elementary school when you can just have an hour and a half of this
anyone else experience this weird phenomenon of white girls that bullied you in high school becoming born again catholics in college and making all their insta stories bible verses
When a popular girl that bullied me in high school asks me to join her pyramid scheme
I know another reason I was bullied so bad was my chest. For my class I was one of the first to develop. I was skinny and large chested. Until High School some girls were jealous so they treated like shit for it.
I know how you feel. That's why I don't even try to date, I've been teased and bullied because of my heart problem. Especially by girls in high school. Now I just don't even want to try, it made me feel so unwanted.
These 'smert, Kool' girls who used to bully me, thinking I was 'unkool, dumb', in school are now putting up ig stories saying 'a woman should support woman'. Didi are you sure?
Every school SHOULD have an anti-bullying policy.Go to the head and ask to see it( if itâ€™s not on the website) . Then go back and insist itâ€™s implemented. If youâ€™re not satisfied, write a letter of complaint to the Chair of Governors. Threaten to report the bullies to the police
I had a dream that in High School, I produced &amp; directed a play called "Dancing Queen" about a girl who was bullied then she went to a dance &amp; out danced all the girls &amp; they called her a dancing queen I will not eat avocados before bed anymore
printed it out at school* bye i dont check what i type
When I was senior in high school, we had a pregnant girl in junior year. She was bullied by both teachers and students , she was top of her class, passed the national exam with the 2nd highest score a month after delivery and went to university a year later. Donâ€™t ruin futures!
When I was in high school there was a girl who got all s sorts of shit and bullied purely because she was 6'1" and it made little short manlets insecure
This Girl is becoming really really disturbing. Poor lass is being brainwashed but the worst thing about it all is that people are actually going along with this. Someone High profile in the Science community needs to start speaking up. Stop being bullied
the way she talks is giving me positive vibes only but i bullied "weird" girls back in high school energy
Iâ€™m a girl but I was bullied at school by a group of guys saying â€œRoyale high is for gay peopleâ€
This song reminds me of the girl who bullied me in high school... WELL. Iâ€™M TAKING IT BACK
Where to begin? I got bullied for being tall for a girl (but they always wanted me in goal for Netball!), for being a huge Doctor Who fan in the 90s/early 00s before it came back &amp; was cool, for having such terrible depression/anxiety that I missed several months of high school..
Okay I understand! I wasn't bullied by girls however I never quite fit in. Being extremely intelligent in all honors or advanced classes...didn't get love from my black community like that. However when I joined the dance team in high school that's when everyone knew my name!
girls who bullied me in high school are music now and im flat
Remember the bullies in school?. One stand off was all it took to stop the fear. Patriots stand up, and watch the scum melt.
sheâ€™s def a girl who would have bullied me in grade school and high school, i can tell by the spider lashes
They wanna be the stereotypical mean girls that once bullied them in high school so bad now that they can hide behind a screen.
I think itâ€™s funny that the girls that bullied me in high school are the same girls paying $70 for carts.
i used to get bullied so badly in middle school by these two girls bc of my acne.. i cried a lot... i didn't see them again until high school but dAMN, karma got them back bc they ended up with worse acne than what i ever had. they shouldn't have been mean to me.

Sending kids back to school is homocide
my bullies threw me out of my wheelchair, they pushed me over in it, my school wouldnâ€™t let me have a wheelchair because they wasnâ€™t â€œprepared for itâ€ and â€œit takes up too much roomâ€ so i had to walk to class everyday and get in trouble for being late because i COULDNT walk.
A girl who bullied me in middle and high school just told me how pretty and successful I am... and well, turns out, sheâ€™s a high school dropout and hasnâ€™t done anything in life :))
Girls who bullied me in high school really want me to support their pyramid schemes now.
Love to see girls who bullied me in high school tweet about being cyberbullied like ok sis you can dish it but you canâ€™t take it
Weâ€™ve all seen Liz in our daily lives. Sheâ€™s the woke girl who claims allyship but doesnâ€™t say a word in front of people if it might hurt her. Itâ€™s popular girl in high school who doesnâ€™t want to stick up for the kid being bullied.
yo i canâ€™t stand that either. i remember this girl from my high school said something really stupid and everybody jumped on the person in her bio which was a guy that had recently died and it was awful. she deserved to get bullied but he didnâ€™t need to be brought up
WASP WAS AND IS A GOOD BOY WHO CARES IF HE WAS A BULLY IN HIGH SCHOOL OR WHATEVER

Last year I invited someone who I would consider one of my "High school bullies" to my wedding. I grew and so did he. People change and grow, it's good. Forgive and love others
That makes me want to contact all the girls I bullied in high school...
I know. If my child was bullying someone I would want to know right away so I could knock some sense into my kid! I was bullied although elementary and middle school. High school wasn't as bad but I'm raising my girls to be respectful human beings!

Jake, I'm sorry your mommy stopped breastfeeding you too soon. I'm sorry you got bullied in school. I'm sorry you couldn't get a girl to like you. I'm sorry that teacher did those things to you in the jr. high locker room. I suggest you change your name to Karen. It's acceptable.
Idk why I would get so pissed off when bullies would call me gay in grade school. They werenâ€™t wrong
i remember we had exchange students from france in high school and they got bullied but at the time i didnt know why, then apparently they were misogynists who said that girls who liked reading were freaks and women should stay home lmao yt ppl....
Does mocking one of the top scientist in the country make you feel powerful? This is how bullies treat geeks in school. Grow up!
Colin was a used by his parents and bullied, the only friends he made were the stray dogs at the park. The people at school used to call him â€œdog breathâ€ He always went to church in hope for a better tomorrow but one day his bully killed all of his friends then he killed himself+
I just read through what people wrote to my on my high school year book and half of them said â€œstop abusing meâ€ lmfaooo. Damn I WAS A BULLY???
I find it hilarious when all of the girls that bullied me in high school claim that they were bullied like??? By who girl? Yourself??

Back in like.. 2014 or 2015.. I had such a bad bout of stress caused by school and bullies that my neck locked up- turning it hurt like a bitch and I immediately had to turn it back or it wouldn't stop- and I couldn't move it for like two weeks. It's nothing special. Just an +
Teenager shoots up a school: Society: OMG how could this happen?! I know we live in a society full of cruel people and teach them violence is how we solve disagreements and encourage bullies. wow I know it must be the guns.
Some of those bullies in school became governors, Judges, ministers and presidents...so they continue to bully Nigeria #SayNoToNipostFee
itâ€™s funny how people who used to bully me in elementary school through 8th grade give me nothing but compliments now
In high school i was bullied a lot. I never felt asian enough or white enough, but being at an international all girls school had a lot of messed up dynamics and challenges, one of which for me was receiveing notes in my locker daily to do my parents a favor and go kill myself.
P4: All the adults are stupid
So, you honestly think he could come across worse than Trump? Why are you sucking up to this school yard bully?

My friend is a high school teacher and was spat at several times a week before COVID!! Kids DO NOT CARE!! The VAPE, VANDALIZED, and Treat teachers horrible!! Come on!!!!!! Seriously there's a zero tolerance for bullies and nothing gets done about that!! What a joke!!!!!
I watched my daughters attend high school as the white minority girls. Oldest didnâ€™t have an issue; youngest was bullied by group of mean girls. They later said â€œyou are cool, we misjudged you b/c of how you lookedâ€
Also letâ€™s talk abt thrift store saoirse Ronan in the first and the girl on the left in the third who probably wouldâ€™ve bullied me in jr high but can get it now....
have i ever had a good experience at a hospital? no. because we let idiots become doctors and all of the bitchy girls who bullied you in high school are the ones who went to college to be nurses and physicianâ€™s assistants
they literally look like the group of girls who bullied me in high school
How is it that only the girls who were literal bullies in school end up being nurses??
#whyididntreportit i was 14 and man was 19. I was blacked out drunk and still have little recollection of what exactly happened. All the girls in high school found out because it was this girls ex boyfriend and bullied me on twitter. You girls know who you are. Sad.
Dear all girls from high school who bullied me and then became nurses: this is the candidate for you!!!
fun fact some bullies threw my shoe on top of the school roof and she climbed up on it and got it down for me
they look like theyâ€™d attempt to bully you in middle school and then act different when guys are around throughout high school
He said his school is 99% bullies, and he had no friends, bad parenting might be in there too
I am so sick and tired of seeing bully cops imposing their will on innocent protesters. These are the same piece of shit bullies that I used to stand up to in high school. Unfortunately, stopping violence can be ugly. Lots of fights, nothing solved. Teach compassion early.
Middle school, I was a bully; 9th grade, I was a bully; 10th grade, I was a bully; 11th grade, I was bullied; 12th grade, didn't give a fuck
I now work in an office with two women that are exactly like the girls I was bullied by in high school.
There once was this boy in my class who got bullied because of his pimples. I didn't bully him but I didn't help him either, maybe because I did not interact much with anyone. However, when we had an exchange with a high school in Belgium and I talked with the Belgian girls...
is it just me or are all the popular girls from high school in MLM schemes now?????? no i do not want your arbonne, you literally bullied me.
NEVER too late - I got a message from a girl, part of a group in high school that bullied me so much I stopped trying to make friends with girls till a couple years ago. She helped heal my heart, just from a short text. Transformation happens, itâ€™s human, own it, share it.
I started school in Darwin 1971...Cheesy warm milk, soggy straws; bullies and the big kids grabbed the chocolate, runts like me got plain... might explain my â€œlarge vats of warm milkâ€ intolerance. Quease making
hell no sheâ€™s not. she posted when we were in high school about how wrong being gay was &amp; a girl called her out for texting her &amp; sending her nudes. sheâ€™s bullied multiple people &amp; iâ€™ll be damned if she thinks she can add me to the list.
Hello girl who I have not talked to since high school where I brutally bullied you would you be interested in making 1000+ a month where you sell tea that makes you shit yourself uncontrollably, love u xx
You bullied and mocked a young girl trying to spread the message about the importance of the climate change debate. Donâ€™t try to take the moral high ground here when you donâ€™t behave or act appropriately either
My friends yesterday told me I was brave to accept the friend request on Facebook from the girl who bullied me in high school. I answered that I'm more mature now and I moved on. That girl seems a different person now, honestly I'm glad she's living her redemption arc.
are you braindead? I am a Indian if a American kid comes to school here people will bully cuz of his race and yes I have seen that happen cuz in that particular insiatan in that particular school that dude is the minority, whats not clickin?
that meme about mean girls in school becoming nurses is 100% true because this girl who bullied me and hated me from elementary school-high school is a nurse at my aunts care facility now.
Your high school bully voted for trump
That happened to me too. Bullied in high school. My locker was in the bottom. Two white girls, even though Iâ€™m white, dropped their books on me laughing. It was a scratch and push. Stupid. It never happened again. Always stand and deliver!
Cortez is a hate crime against men - feminist misandry from gold digger Cortez, as she acts like a cry baby in the school yard, blaming the bully boy, using lies promoting herself &amp; motivating bias against the boy-this is an attack on all boys @POTUS @HouseDemocrats @democrats
Helping my mum track down the girls who bullied her in high school on Facebook to make sure theyâ€™re doing worse than her now
I'm down 7 facebook friends since yesterday. (I haven't checked the twitter count). That's fine. In high school, I ached to be the popular girl. I was very much not. I was bullied every single day for being unapologetically myself--just for being me.
not my middle school bully coming out as a lesbian bitch i think you owe me an apology
aside from being sexually harassed, one of the most traumatic experience was when a group of high school girls bullied me when i was in third grade for a reason i donâ€™t know about :)
you know if you told me yesterday that netflix's next big movie is a story about a girl who gets bullied in high school learning to love herself, and that the title was Tall Girl, I would have thought it would be about... something slightly different
Haha the girls who bullied me in high school are looking/acting like me now :&gt; we love being an influential sweetheart
Iâ€™m horrified. I just saw this girl who I went to grade school and high school with on my foryoupage on Tik Tok... the bitch bullied me all throughout school.
do you bully people with autism a lot when you were at school?
This girl I went to high school with bullied me bc I wasnâ€™t popular or pretty. She told me Iâ€™d never glo up .
Are you sure..? Bc I got bullied all throughout middle school and high school by girls bc they didnâ€™t find me pretty. Iâ€™ve seen plenty of woman harass and create problems for people they donâ€™t find attractive.. they are more problematic than men
Gov Lee, You & TN are on the wrong side of saving lives from pandemic. Do the right thing & mandate masks. And give schools necessary resources to be safe. You are failing TN residents on both fronts. @realDonaldTrump
kinda look like my middle school bully with my glasses on and I don't like that
Commended & to all who can & are wearing one. Its getting out of hand in some quarters towards bona-fide peoples who are except, like me. I have a history from school, army &amp; life of not tolerating bullies, which the mask issue is bringing out. Hopefully all will calm down soon X
The girl who bullied you in high school but now wants to sell you Arbonne
Jack would prolly suspend people for wearing their hoods to class or some bs like that and wouldn't suspend the racists and the students would have to bully them off school property to not make them come back since he won't do shit about it
For being mildly overweight because I went to a school where all the other girls were a size two. I got bullied by both girls and guys, started in middle school and ended with my entire group of "friends" abandoning me when we graduated high school. Said they were done pretending
Most of my friends that were girls just stopped talking to me irl. Cause Iâ€™m boring lol. I didnâ€™t get along with girls in high school because I got bullied by most of them. So I just kept to myself. I see where you are coming from though! I feel like we are raised to be toxic.
the plot of the webtoon was this guy who got bullied in high school gets plastic surgery as an adult to look ultra hot and then he homewrecks his bullys relationship (both the guy AND the girl) to make them both ready to leave their partner for him
god bless Facebook... nice to see that the girls that bullied me in high school have butt ugly boyfriends..
Girls who bullied me in high school for being a slut: Can you PLEASE help me get into porn?!!! I really need the money!!!
Donald Trump says it's illegal to bully. where are the bitches from middle school that made my life hell
Condo salesman paid someone else to take his SAT his sister Maryanne did his homework for him in high school oh yeah he is a bully not a fighter. Grifter
Offenders need to acknowledge their crime, but they shouldnâ€™t in turn be abused every day on their incarceration by prison guard bullies. These 14yr olds are possibly not achieving in school, or life at home. Rehabilitation is there only hope.
I often think about the days I was bullied in middle and high school.... and those same girls/ boys bullying me are eating the words they spoke.
I wore a Pokemon shirt to school once and didn't hear the end of it until summer And then in high school I saw half of the guys and girls who bullied me for liking Pokemon wearing retro Pokemon merch and I was like ?????
every girl in this photo has a twitter bio that says "loves jesus all about kindness!!!!" even though back in high school she once bullied 3 girls so bad they got eating disorders
You must be very young, in a changed world. My son in the 90s in High School had a gay friend. He was teased and taunted along with the other kid. He protected him from the bullies.
VOTE FOR THIS MAN OR Iâ€™LL BULLY YOU SO BAD YOU TRANSFER SCHOOLS
I taught school for over 30 years. My first and second graders did not stoop to name calling like you do as an adult. You are not a mature leader. You definitely missed out on something in your your childhood or education. Such a bully.
I remember one time when I was bullied in high school and I beat up this girl and I was suspended my math teacher told me when I came back even the devil in hell has his limits lol I am with my limit with Trump and his bullying people should be tired of trump picking on people
No, it's not boring. I was bullied by Darwin Brodt, a PA Heavyweight(185+lbs) Wrestling Champion for 2 years while I attended Easton Area High School in the 70s. I made the error of beating him during a 2 by 2 one lap swim in Gym class. He bullied girls too. DB was very insecure.
its always the girlies who bullied me in junior high posting the â€œpositivity always! love everybody! girls supporting girlsâ€ stuff, like girl shut up
Very unfair says the one everyone thinks is a bully because of the ones who are truly the bullies, if this were school. I think it's actually treasonous &amp; despicable. But if they're 'fighting to win' because the wrong outcome puts THEM in jail or major fall &amp; disgrace? Reality
the girl who bullied me in high school just started her own YouTube channel. should i subscribe?
one time i got kind of bullied in high school bc this girl who was directly in my line of vision every day always dressed really normal but like ONE thing about her outfit would be so wrong that i couldnâ€™t look away and she told her friends i stare at her
UR A HIGH SCHOOL BULLY
HOOOOOO BOY MY FAMILY HAD PEOPLE OVER AND ONE OF THEM IS A KID WHO USED TO BULLY ME IN MIDDLE SCHOOL F U C K
oh my god watching inception live again and jongho's outfit... why they gotta do that. everyone looks like badass gangster school bullies and jongho looks like the lil nerd with perfect grades that gets bullied. WHY.
I didn't say he was stubborn; I said he was a bully. He's bullied activists, other VT politicians, and especially the media. He's even bullied High School students.
Idk if you remember me but it's Chet from high school. Thank you for confronting that bully that shoved me in a locker and ate my Meatball Sub. A real hero.
He was a bully in high school.
girls that bullied me in high school be like
This is like. If you have a little sibling and you give them shit because theyâ€™re annoying and make your life miserable but all of a sudden the school bully starts picking on them and youâ€™re like. Wait hold on. Only I can do that. Back off. Thatâ€™s how I feel about Trump and TW rn
If you told me that the girl who bullied me in high school would be in a bar laughing with my boss in front of me in 2019 I wouldâ€™ve been like nah but here we are
Independent investigation into bullying policy at Broadoak Sports College (Hazel Wood High School) Bury, Lancashire and GMP full investigation - Sign the Petition! http://chng.it/bCPGJ7Fs via @Change This girl was bullied by her white peers &amp; they got to walk away, PLS SIGN!!
They only do nasty. Any middle school bully could do this all day long.
Guys that bullied girls in high school started going bald in their 20â€™s.
I was bullied for my size, for the fact i was always quiet. I had people hitting me, throwing things at me, calling me all sorts of things. I had one girl make fun of me for wearing shorts to school, i quit wearing shorts until i graduated high school, even at home..
Huh... he seems very much to me like the typical school yard bully boy. Can imagine him pulling wings of cicadas &amp; flushing your footy cards down the dunny. We all know the type. #scottyfommarketing #scottnofriends
The bully at school
I canâ€™t stand Kenya she is such a fake she never was her mean self around her husband but he found out himself and left her. By the way her hair is as fake as she is. Sheâ€™s that girl in school that just was the biggest bully. Shes not a good person
Lol right! I was bullied in middle school so I spent most of high school and college just observing. Girls always seemed to have endless drama going on while boys would have beef squash it and move on Even if it escalated to fighting guys would fight and be done...but not girls
I was thinking earlier about some girls that bullied me in high school. I wish I would have told them then to bite me. I know now that they were insecure bitches, but at the time it only made me feel horrible.
so funny to see that all the girls who bullied me in high school are desperately trying to be tiktok famous lol
I do. One look at them and you know they were bullied by pretty girls in high school
Have you been causing trouble again Harriet! Were you the bully at school?
How is sprite treated in canterlot high in the equestria girls universe ? â€” She's not really bullied, but she's also not super popular. Most of what she does social-wise is follow either Snowie or Understudy around as they do theiâ€¦
I have never been ashamed of a president until now Donald Trump thinks he can bully us if everybody just gets up one day at the same time and says no more an keep saying it until he's kicked out of office and used in schools as what a president shouldn't be for rest of Eternity
No I was not popular in high school because I was teased in high school and I was bullied by the guys and girls
*CHANGE IS REAL!! NO MATTER HOW LONG THE TIME FRAME!!* I go into my weed shop right? Without hesitation this employee I've never seen goes: "I used to bully you in school. On the bus. I'm so sorry". Mind you I have my mask on the entire since getting out of the car. Cont:
I'm giving up on ABC,they can't be salvaged. they don't even know how fucken dumb they are. Stupid drunken private school bully boys and second rate tabloid turds. Australia by definition of media, has no media. Seek information via American public media, or new Zealand.
When Tom is scrunched on the #football field by the school bully, Devlin, he needs a major operation on his shoulder. He comes out of hospital with the miraculous gift of being able to turn #cricket ball miles - a gift that transforms his life. #podcast http://ow.ly/tBbC30qYzPO
I really wasn't bullied much as a kid kid. For the most part my class was pretty decent...until jr. high and this girl hated me &amp; would bully me but after everyone caught on they pretty much shunned her and her friends for a bit.
Just found out my elementary school bully just died from a drug overdose. Her funeral was today. Idk how I feel.
i used to joke about this with a girl who was a tintin fan in high school. I basically bullied her with the idea that Tintin was bending over for Haddock. Today, I am Nostradamus.
Johnny True, the school bully, was on his way to own someone will be perfect and will have all gone.
these are the kinda dudes you would defend from getting bullied all through middle school, and then this is the bullshit they start doing when yâ€™all get to high school. And they wanna be rude as hell to you. The white girls can HAVE you, bruh.
i don't have a lot of girlfriends. Probs because I don't other girls easily...and because I was bullied by them in high school and middle school, etc. But, I'm glad to not have a lot. Because it's exhausting trying to be their friend.
THESES ARE BULLLIES HIGH SCHOOL BULLIES
one of the things i hate almost as much as cops is white girls who bullied me in high school becoming nurses
Funny oy! So immature and uncultured GIRL MINYO NAKA DONâ€™T ACT AS IF YOUâ€™RE A TEENAGER WHO GOT BULLIED BY HIGH SCHOOL FRIEND
me being triggered by seeing a pic of the girl who bullied me in high school vs me remembering her kid is ugly as fuuuuuuuck
Never noticed how much being bullied in high school has affected me... from the corner of my eye, I knew these girls were purposely staring at me from a distance, for long periods of time. So flash forward to 10 years later, Iâ€™m always paranoid that Iâ€™m getting stared at
Important albums from high school or why people would bully me https://twitter.com/theslothygirl/status/1287977322222694401
Watch out for your child. My bullies almost killed me and my parents did nothing. Today my Mom can't believe she did nothing. I'd already taken a scholarship to a private school I didn't really want to go to so as to be away from them. It wasn't enough.
This girl who got relentlessly bullied in High School is becoming more and more famous as a â€œreal life mermaidâ€ and honestly it fills me with joy
when i was younger i mainly idolized the girls instead of crushing on them &gt;.&lt; i was bullied by a lot of girls growing up so i didnt even entertain the thought of finding them cute until i was late late high school
People associated the girls who were outspoken about sex with degrading terms. Those girls who were slut-shamed in high school because they were hypersexual due to abuse/sexual assault in ther lives. We just called them sluts and further bullied them.
We cant just let this stand. Its even worse - Sen. Cotton wants to bully schools which want to use the 1619 Project curriculum by defunding them. Mindless defense of the status quo and mythology over history doesn't fly anymore.
Actually, I think that depends on the injured person. A couple of high school bullies apologized in private first and sent a draft of their public apology for my permission to post, and I appreciated that so much more than I would have them not asking. I am a VERY private person.
Superbad is about Evan, a bullied high school nerd headed for Dartmouth who canâ€™t get laid. I was a bullied high school nerd, clueless about girls, who went to Dartmouth. My best friend was named Evan. Oh, and Judd Apatow and I went to the same high school, 6 years apart.
...watching a middle school bully trying to convince his victims heâ€™s gonna be nice nowâ€”while tossing a dirt clod in one hand.
The girls from my high school that bullied me
bullying in nursing is so bad that im doing a whole assignment on how i would respond if i get bullied in the workplace - apparently the mean girl in high school reputation is so true theres actual research articles on it
This is the girl from your high school that bullied everyone and then went to nursing school but really only became an alcoholic
this girl was bullied in high school I just know it
Cass is that high school bully that never grows up. Yuck #BachelorInParadiseAU
he exposed my friend's nudes and poor her got bullied by everyone !!! he slept with girls in highschool and told everyone sad to see he's still the same prick from high school
i already got bullied and shoved in lockers throughout high school and all the girls laughed at me for being a cancer please stop
this is the type of white girl that would bully me in school
We get it you were bullied in high school but you donâ€™t have to be a mean girl now BREAK THE CYCLE
MEEEEE got bullied in high school for being a brown girl....Sorry my skin colour bothers you so much!
Agreed but these â€œpeopleâ€ you speak of are just bullies who peaked in high school that hide behind riot gear. Theyâ€™ve destroyed medical supplies and food for those who need it most with chemical weapons. Theyâ€™ve illegally arrested and beaten people standing up for Black lives.
So many people I know were traumatized by mean girls in school. I'm going to try to cover the issue in my blog soon. I've done general bullies and slut shaming and bullying "in the name of religion." Even with my current empty nest the issues are still there. #Parenting #Blogs
if she is new,she will not have access to go to trading up cause you need to be high level to go there,for my opinion she should not put bullying into this cause some really got bullied.That girl needs to stop lying cause no one gives a crap :)
things my school did: tell my entire class my dad died without my permission literally let teachers bully me and target me for absolutely no reason leak confidential information again tell me i didnâ€™t need counselling bc it was â€˜superficialâ€™ and wouldnâ€™t help me anymore
Bullies that we all had to deal with in school are now the cops that are bullying us in our city.
why did i have a dream that a girl that bullied me in high school tried to recruit me for a pyramid scheme
this is what the girls who bullied me at my christian high school wore on dress down days
some of yâ€™all act like high school bullies and itâ€™s odd
My most prominent high school memories are me being homeless, having a sex tape leak, almost dropping out and being bullied by every girl in the school bc I was close with the guy they wanted to fuck memories
more like this is how you create school shooters, bullies and lunatics. but it definitely stops the talk back, you are right there.
Yup, defending your statement The vid is of a high school girl taking out the guy who bullied her
high school, 4 albums donâ€™t bully me too much (still got one year of high school left but thatâ€™s neither here nor there) tagging anyone because anyone who i wouldâ€™ve tagged has already done it https://twitter.com/lolleea/status/1287841425430806530
From here on out Iâ€™m going to start pronouncing it â€œfahvruhâ€ again like I did in my head when I read it on the back of my bullyâ€™s jersey in elementary school because I hadnâ€™t heard someone say it out loud yet and obviously didnâ€™t care that much about football. #BrettFavre
please tell me why i got a long-ass facebook message from the girl who relentlessly bullied one of my best friends in middle and high school explaining that she blocked me on twitter not because i came out as a lesbian, but because i â€œcontributed to her traumaâ€
Is it me or does he look exactly like the stereotype of a blond high school bully in America?
definitely got the vibes of "hey remember when these girls bullied you in high school bc you couldn't speak spanish or you were 'too white' to be a real latin person" from the voices alone
She's a typical school bully. Very bitter if she's not getting attention. She's venemous &amp; her language would have her sanctioned if she was a male politician. It's also quite messed up, way she pulls her son out if heat is on. Child should not be in public forums! Awful creature
The junior high school bullies are not happy. Didn't we teach anti-shaming and bullying in the school system?
Ngl it gives me the vibes of shipping someone with their school bully.
Girls at school with her say she was a bully.
Oh lord, throughout high school I refused to change with the other girls, because I was ashamed of my weight... Iâ€™m not the biggest, but Definetly not the ideal Weight and was terrified of being bullied. Seeing some appreciation for people of different sizes is really nice.
Take him to a boxing club ... i used to get bullied at school until I started kickboxing when I was 11 and started to knock few bullies out that every one stopped fucking with me .
when i was a kid i told my friend we should rap battle all the teachers and bullies in our school to the beat of brass monkey by the beastie boys and earn our respect that way
It seems you really enjoyed telling the public how you snared people on Pandemic Unemployment Payment at the airport. You were like a tell-tale bully school boy on Lawlor's show. Do you get off on classist prejudice? you're vilification of those less fortunate is not endearing..
my â€œbest friendâ€ in middle school who then bullied me and was a total cunt to me and other girls from middle school and high school, got arrested for the 5th time the other day, yikes. karma never has a day off hunty!!!
bullies didnt go hard enough when bezos, zuckerberg, cook and musk were in school
it BLOWS MY MIND SoCal kids didnâ€™t have outdoor ed? like did you actually have a childhood if you didnâ€™t have to kiss a banana slug and sing songs about xylem and bunk with the girl who bullied you through most of junior high?
I'm so proud of myself I said to my school bully that I'm not afraid of you anymore and thanks for making my life miserable and I told her I have a lot of people on my back and blocked her
asked a former high school bully on this anonymous ask thing if he was gay.... TELL ME WHY HE DMâ€™D ME â€œnah broâ€
the ghost middle school bullies twisted your arms
You sound like a bit of a school bully... and maybe you should get some help.
I'm the girl who bullied you in high school, who stole your money and gave you s... https://onlyfans.com/eclairxo
On a genuine note though, why doesn't he fight back? My daughter had 2 girls in particular give her hell. U know me she resisted my advice until one PE session. I told to grab that blond head with blue eyes on the lockers. Throughout high school no one ever bullied her again
Right wing is the classic closeted gay football team quarterback bully from high school who keeps shoving you up against your locker and pinning you there
itâ€™s crazy how the meanest people always end up going into the professions where they are supposed to help people. mean girls from high school become nurses, while the boys who consistently bullied those around them and thought it was cool become police officers.
i donâ€™t care about being bullied on social media because speaking out about bringing justice an innocent black man is more important to me than high school girls telling me to â€œget w itâ€
Yes, I was in Grade 6 when they bullied for being the "pretty girl" Which led me to start wearing tshirt, jeans, and sneakers when I started high school to draw less attention to myself.
She really helped me through a tough time in high school when I was bullied for being â€œdark and edgyâ€ and I went to school with all blonde preppy girls lol.. she gave me hope that I didnâ€™t have to be the stereotypical â€œgirly girlâ€ to be a wrestler. Honestly helped save my life.
what if I grew up not in the life I am right now, went to private school, grew up with amazing privileges, I wonder what kind of a person will I be? will i be the bullied or the bully? will I be the same person that I am?
And yeah, iâ€™m defending the media in this instance, because theyâ€™ve done nothing wrong. They didnâ€™t slander the kids name, it was the people who figured out who he was, and did what they did. Thatâ€™s like punishing a school for a bully, bullying another student. Itâ€™s fucking dumb.
MOST OF THE ----OH F*CK----LETS STOP WITH THE PROTESTER MONIKER--THAT WENT BYE BYE A LONG TIME AGO! THE DOMESTIC TERRORISTS! THEY ARE ALL YOUNG IDIOTS, PUNKS, OUR EX CONS! TEENAGERS WHO ARE THUG WANNABEES! FORMER SCHOOL BULLY DROPOUTS AND UGLY MUGLY DOPES WHO COULDN'T GET A DATE!

*are around 12 years old. One is a few years younger than 12. Very little changed since my mother and uncle were in school where my uncle was bullied constantly &amp; called homophobic slurs yet they were punished for fighting against bullies... I no longer have faith in the system
Shouldn't you be in school fag @BriannaDeanne
I'll never forget Priyanka Chopra lying that a black girl that bullied her in high school
school bullies have been stuck in a time loop since 2004
Probably bullied the girl whose calves were too thick to wear knee-high boots.
This girl accompanied me in the library of my high school where I hid from people who bullied me, and aided my transition into LIFE a year later, only for us to see new beginnings in London together. Thank you for being the hero that YOU are. Happy Birthday @Marzzx__. I love you.
Except for the b***** next to me who have no etiquette. They bullied young middle/high school girls out of their front row spots, invaded everyoneâ€™s personal space, and tried jumping over the gate and ONTO stage. They deserved to be thrown out
exactly????? literally have seen my middle school bullies on tiktok
Ohh hunni, Everyone has a past, @JeffreeStar has apologised multiple times, Grow the fuck up girl! Iâ€™m sure if I googled you enough Iâ€™d find a past too, Whatâ€™s ur issue, Daddy Issues? Parents Divorced ? Ugly and bullied in high school? And now you have to take ur anger out online
Sheâ€™s like a high school girl writing in her diary after getting bullied
I got bullied for having long hair up to 8th grade when I finally decided to cut it off to avoid being called a girl in high school. And in high school, I just never really fit in. Now I'm rocking some 3ft+ long hair!
Honestly not sure. Thereâ€™s a lot of d*cks at my school but not really bullies
A shitty ex bf, a girl who bullied me all through high school, a toxic ex best friend who took advantage of my family and my kindness, just to name a few.
William Barr is the school bully that would justify stealing your lunch money. By saying it was no big deal because you would not starve. You could still eat dinner when you got home from school. @michaelschweitz @SChristy16
twitter, riddle me this. when I was in high school, a girl bullied me and told me the world would be a better place if i killed myself. she is now one of my cousins bridesmaids. am i allowed to be bitter?
Our school follows an anti-bullying policy and my math teacher is a bully should I complain??
BLACK is being bullied by a group of white girls and finally standing up for yourself and getting reported to your parents for being aggressive and hostile. BLACK is to lower your town, fix your accent, get bullied for your lips and nose just to avoid being bullied in high school
I got bullied by girls a lot in high school but when this one guy called me poor it hurt the most
Ignore the NFL. Treat them as if they do not exist. After they kneel during the anthem there will be no NFL. Overpaid jocks & wannabe gangbangers whose grades were pencil whipped since High School where they raped the girls and bullied the boys. National Felons League. #Standup
GOONIES + ARU SHAH To locate a magical cure that will save his dying father, 13-yr-old Sam goes to the land of Decapolis with his 2 bfâ€™s. Theyâ€™re hailed as heroes, returned from the past - which has its benefits. But then a 4th â€œheroâ€ shows up - the school bully #SFFpit #MG #F
they immediately go to calling you a freak and ugly because they weren't able to be bullies in school despite how badly they wanted to be
He made the lib tards look like a bunch school yard bullies that just got punched in the face!
I love local politics in the midwest bc half the candidates are mothers of girls who bullied me for being gay in high school, and I have to vote for them bc their opponents believe abortion is a sin punishable by death
Itâ€™s so unbelievably EASY to get you guys to jump to violence. You have zero defense in your support for Trump. The High School bully wants to kick my ass. BIG SURPRISE
these are HIGH SCHOOL BULLIES
I legit have like idk how many of those backpacks bc I keep losing them at school bc a bully keeps taking them soooo ya
extra hard mode is where one of the nurses was the girl who bullied you in high school
I'm really sorry that you have to work with elementary school bullies. Hopefully this province elects fewer of them next time
I honestly think the roles of High School are going to completely change in the future. Kids will be bullied for being homophobic, not for being gay. Boys will have no power leaking nudes bc who cares. Girls wonâ€™t get slut shammed. And racists, rapists, cheaters will be exposed
I see a lot of people criticizing #TallGirl and I can understand your point of vue ! I mean whatâ€™s wrong with being tall ? Nothing. During middle school &amp; high school kids are the meanest and some kids especially girls can get or are bullied for being tall! Itâ€™s a real issue !
Found one of my high school bullies on tinder today!!
so you hate the other person, and since I knew you from middle school you hate me as much always a bully

The cops don't like a fair fight. They like to fight vulnerable people, weaker than them, and who can't fight back. They are just school bullies, grown up, who have been given deadlier weapons.
ahaha having an anxiety attack outside a nail salon bc you're on your own and the girls inside look like all the girls that bullied you in high school
Quite a few of my bullies have been girls growing up. One apologized at a debate comp after years of moving school etc But that bully or be bullied idea was in my head for quite a few of my formative years.
If I showed my legs my mom would literally say how big they are and ask why they were so swollen. It got to the point I LIKED being at school bc the bullies at school bullied me less than my parents. My dad once tried to BRIBE me to lose weight. I was 13. I had no idea how to.
you hijacking my aussie primary school bully-culture chants????? :O
Vaush bullied the girl he debated yesterday, Vaush would use minorities for his arguments while disrespecting them and he will shame them for not voting for their oppression while parading in Biden merch. Wants black ppl to be â€œpeacefulâ€ while they die. Iâ€™m the asshole tho?
You both need to take on the bullies b/c you can't run from them, they're everywhere, first does school recognise they have a bullying issue, if you don't get satisfaction there, go and complain to your education department with your local council, then there is the local papers.
My middle school bully has been coming in. Wonder if she remembers me
Forgotten my school bullies they wouldnâ€™t want to meet me now cuz Iâ€™ve grown up wiser and stronger and are pitiful in my head. Hate pitiful bullies

The only time Iâ€™ve been bullied where it actually really got to me was when these girls in high school took a photo of me and captioned it â€œall lives matterâ€
Evy: trying to get into Phoenixâ€™s pants Phoenix: â€œyou know those girls that bullied you in high school all ODâ€™d mysteriously on heroin?â€

You look like an absolute bully of the high school in the first picture. (No offence)
Howâ€™s this girl gonna say she was â€œbulliedâ€ in high school (she wasnâ€™t) when she literally threw a party the day I transferred schools. Like they had party decorations &amp; food &amp; everything. Because I moved.
ODD was a common "diagnosis" when I was in elementary school for class clowns and bullies
I create a comic called Curse of the Eel, itâ€™s about a bullied goth girl in high school whose only friend is the Eldritch Eel creature she accidentally summoned. Itâ€™s a coming of age horror story :D https://m.tapas.io/episode/206778 #comics #horror #friends
My ex wife is Fluent in French, whenever she speaks it, white people always ask stupid questions â€œWhere are you from? America, Are your parents Haitian/ Africans? No. Where did you learn French? In high school &amp; college. Why did you learn French? Because I wanted to ....
I binge watched all his videos and it made me feel so good about myself!! High school bully is now just a drop kick like I was
I'd hate to be a teenager these days. I got bullied in high school for being tall and thin. But not like these girls are. I want my 6 yr old to stay 6. #murderinthevineyard #bully
you can very much tell who got bullied in high school and is using twitter to live out their mean girl fantasies
iâ€™m attracted to tana mongeau in the same way that you are oddly attracted to your middle school bully who calls you homophobic slurs
@PkmnMasterHolly I know how you feel because I was bullied all 4 years of high school by the girls &amp; guys. I had no friends in high school I was always by myself and I was harmfully been called names and others stuff to.
I feel this way about all the girls who bullied me in high school
Just found out that the two girls who bullied me in high school are now both working in schools terrified for the poor kids theyâ€™re going to be in charge of
this is what yâ€™all mean girls from high school look like to me when you message me all â€œOMG YOU LOOK SO GOOD NOW. Pleassseeee tell me your secret.â€ Like..... you literally bullied me for like 7 years??????
My GPA is 3.97, i was a second-in-command for student council, and was one of the leaders in our debate club... Now that im leaving my school the reception lady saw my papers and said that we must talk to the vice principal for not giving me a diploma of academic excellence
I love Facebook because it reminds me when all the birthdays of the girls who bullied me in high school are
â€œShow me a man who has enjoyed his school days and I'll show you a bully and bore.â€ â€• Robert Morley
I hope that the girls that bullied me in high school are good mamas to the little ones they raise.
Name calling needs to stop. DC is a grade school playground with name calling, tattle tales and schoolyard bullies!
and to make it even better, one of the girls almost had me suspended from school because of bullying (which she was bullying me so...? donâ€™t even ask hahahahaha jsut trust she wasnâ€™t being bullied) and sheâ€™s the same one whoâ€™s gonna spit on me and my high risk father
When I was bullied in high school I felt so ashamed that I never asked out a girl who had a crush on for two years because I thought she would laugh right in my face. #BellLetsTalk

Me jumping the school bully for taking my money:
Not really as Iâ€™ve always just popped mine in and let them get on with it, but it might be an idea to ask for well feathered new girls as more likely to be high ranking and less likely to be bullied by your girl
The Anarchists are the bully in school that terrorized everyone. Stealing kids lunch money and scaring them to death. Just like in school, itâ€™s going to take each of us to stand tall and punch this modern day bully right in the mouth sending them back to their motherâ€™s basements!
Ooo look at me being bullied high school style by the girls in uni
THEY LEGIT EMPHATIZED WITH YURIKO AND NOT WITH KUMI ??!!! HOW THE GIRL WAS LITERALLY BULLIED AROUND BY EVERYONE WHILE YURIKO WAS JUST A CR3TIN HIGH SCHOOLER
During dates where we are beating up some cops, fucking bitches and maybe while we watch some movies. And when i am breeding you every 2 hours.
Confirming what? Dude, you are all trying to redo your childhood school yard bully days and failing, it's time to be a grown up now and stop picking on the smart kids.
a girl who bullied me through high school really requested me spam ig
this is seriously so weird to me ppl are trying to pretend that tall ppl dont get bullied for being tall. Literally all through middle school &amp; high school everyone wanted a â€œshort girl â€ and called me a man just for being slightly above average in height. it happens
The film ends where it started with Nimbe murdering his school bully in the glare of everyone. It was his final unraveling as a gangster, completing a total turnaround for a mummy's boy. #NIMBE
these are BULLIES. these are HIGH SCHOOL. FUCKING. BULLIES.
I canâ€™t believe I used to let girls bully me in high school that have their instagram bio saying â€œsunshine with a little mix of hurricaneâ€
//Quite the eager slut.
I think it's girls who got bullied in high school tbh
He literally is the biggest participant in cancel culture. He fires anyone that disagrees with him or that doesnâ€™t kiss his ass. He fires (cancels) them or has Barr do it for him and attacks them on Twitter like a middle school bully.
my best mate said to me once that I look & sound like the girls who bullied her in high school &amp; whilst it was a flippant comment that kind of stuck with me so I'm semi aware of it when I speak to some women esp ones who don't know me; there's times a stranger can't 'read' you &amp;-

girls who bring marble swell bottles to class bullied other girls in high school
These girls who were a year older and bullied me in high school have randomly started going to the gym I've been going to for years. Annoying, but I take comfort in us all being in our mid-30s with weight to lose. TOGETHER.
Exhibit A on how the bullied gay boys in high school turn into the mean white girls once they come out of the closet and take it out on the lesbians
Poop Shop I love how unsubtle and childish it is. Almost like if a school yard bully got into politics. "OH YEAH? WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF THE GAYLIBS GOT IN CHARGE?! GO TO THE POOP SHOP?!" Outstanding.
High school is not all sunshine and rainbows. Other things some people tend to ignore is the fact that students get bullied, administrators care more about what the students wear rather than their actual education, girls tend to get called the weak gender, males are.. (3..)
The way I was like opening this tweet 'huh so ppl do like deep voices, why have i been bullied, told i sound like a man, and called slurs then' and then looked at the replies and realised ooooh they mean pretty girls with 'normal, feminine, but not too high' voices lmao
Love this woman that is the office bully reflecting on being bullied in high school because the girls were jealous of her and the boys wanted to date her

Yea I hated when all the girls bullied me in high school
Always loved â€˜Back ago Schoolâ€™. Writing naughty stuff on the black board then having the teacher chase you around was a blast... At least we know where Rockstar got the idea for â€˜Bullyâ€™
Dehza get bullied at school /: my poor bby!
just realized i would have probably been my bfâ€™s high school bully

My sister was getting bullied in high school for her bad acne and thick eyebrows and her tomboy style and the teacher told her that maybe if her mom got her girl clothes, got some medication for her acne, and got her eyebrows done the bullying would lessen. I KID YOU NOT!!!!
girls that bullied me in high school now wanting me to do their hair lmao no bitch
i just blocked one of the girls who bullied me in high school on YELP lol life is weird wow
If you're tweeting about getting bullied by a girl in junior high I don't think it would be much of a contest...
Every bully I had in high school that swore they invented the word "queerburger" and spoke mostly in 300 quotes
Every time ahmed thinks and says something about him and thinks he is hot and sexy and whatevery im like bro u the type of dude girls never date and in high school used to be bullied
Of course, @realDonaldTrump. Those bully tactics of yours have worked out so well for you, thus far. #ByeDon2020 #ONEV1 Z25 Trump proposes defunding public schools that donâ€™t open during the pandemic -
I am surprised he never got beat up in military school if he did he would never admit but yeah I guess he must have bought friends as his posse, I did hear he was a bully in military school.
@Aiden_Zhane I really liked you on #DragRace Iâ€™m so sorry a lot of the girls bullied you especially @thebritafilter who apparently can only fell better when sheâ€™s dragging another queen down. So hold your head high and now there are those who saw you and loved you
he looks like a girl who would've bullied me in high school and im into it
This is like saying you gotta ignore the bullies at school and donâ€™t give them a reaction. But thatâ€™s what assholes want you to feel, powerless. Donâ€™t stop standing up for yourself!
I love seeing girls that were bullied in high school, really living their best lives now. Gettin their bag, exploring, falling in love, knowing who they are. Like you didnâ€™t peak in HS and you are so beautiful for that!
idk why i paid to see a clown w a big forehead bully people when the girls in my high school class bullied me for free
a middle to high school GIRL. But itâ€™s actually coming from a grown ass â€œmanâ€. I have texts that show how respectful &amp; understanding I tried to be . But when Iâ€™m getting bullied &amp; things are being demanded from me. I draw the line. I know the truth .
Kai: I really like this girl please donâ€™t ruin this for me guys Taemin: arenâ€™t you the guy who bullied me in high school? I still wonâ€™t forgive you for pushing me around and taking my lunch money
Watch your tone, Donald! Your handlers want you to pretend you donâ€™t have the maturity of a grade-school bully for the next 100 days!
Who i am. - firstly, im a daughter to a mother who came to Israel from Russia because of antisemitism. They used to be poor and people used to bully my mom in her school in russia, they really couldnâ€™t take that anymore so they left everything and came to Israel to
You guys are very mean, like school yard bully mean, to women who are unambiguously black.
Itâ€™s the grammar school equivalent of having cooties. Itâ€™s what bullies say to leave others out. People who call others racists now are simply bullies.
it's funny because that was the name of the girl that bullied me in high school
Daaaamn boy. I actually was more of the "skip school with my skater clique to go get kicked out of the mall" kinda loser than a nerd or bully.
In high school I used to get bullied by a special ed girl bitch would dead ass hit me, and like fuck was I supposed to do
A child does random acts to â€˜helpâ€™ the builder on his own initiative. Clearly you donâ€™t have children, itâ€™s what children do, try & help! As for accusing the builder of bullying for his letter & Â£10 pay. Bullyâ€™s at your school must have been crap if you got paid by them!
Feels like a reunion day for me because this girl who used to bully me throughout high school came in also! And sadly she has not grown up and bullied me when I was helping her lol. Wish I could crawl in bed with my cat, I need lovin
Yâ€™all act like when kids come back to school they arenâ€™t going to be sent to school sick. Or that bullies will be purposefully coughing on thier targets, usually minorities, especially around where I live and in rural areas. That shit is fucking insane.
high school bullies stop becoming nurses challenge
girl on the right looks like she bullied me in high school why are these people nurses
Koe no Katachi. Is a really good movie about a guy who bullied a deaf girl in junior school. And tries to make things right in high school. Bit of an emotional roller coaster tho
@SenTomCotton from what I understand you were the lil bitch all through school then you figured out you could get any degree then join the military and nobody could really bully you but you could shit on others and never be in harms way pussy
He usually does. I think he believes that if he insults someone enough theyâ€™ll leave. If he can get them to leave, in his mind heâ€™s â€œwonâ€. I just find him to be a child like bully. He probably got beat up a lot in school.
You sound like the school bully inviting the little guy over so that the bully can punch the little guy in thw face to prove that the bully is not a bully.
-The Best Ever-
From being bullied in middle school for being overweight, to freshman year turning into a bully because of my insecurity, to now, my senior year. I can confidently say I don't give a fuck what people think anymore, and I am proud of my "transformation" and I will continue.
funny how a bunch of dance moms, girlies, teachers & competition judges will see a boy potentially bullied about choosing a â€œgirlyâ€ activity &amp; encourage him w featured roles n high scores but a girl playing football is a nuisance and usually barely tolerated :/
MovieGems#72: Three Oâ€™Clock High (1987). Nebbish but likeable bookworm somehow offends the hulking school bully and spends the rest of the movie trying to avoid the inevitable showdown after class. No angst, no parent-hating, just a brisk, funny, brilliantly directed gem.
Jackson -THE jock -captain of all the school sports teams -nicest man you know -happy, average grades -is everyones friend -asks to copy your homework -doesn't listen in classes -secretly really smart -just wants to enjoy his time -if you bully someone he's gonna hit ya
cass was definitely a high school bully and has never left that high school hierarchy mentality #BachelorInParadiseAU
Just to recap on Victoria F accusations/facts: Modeled for Confederate &amp; White Lives Matter Gear Stole multiple BFF's husband's Bullied girls in high school for their bodies That's it...for today. #TheBachelor
It's 7th grade. I was being bullied every day by a group of girls. She was probably being bullied by these boys. Kids are cruel in Jr. High, but this lie could have cost these boys everything.
Mom is asking me to attend my high school reunion.. She doesn't know I was bullied in high school. Those Ilongga girls were mean to me. It was awful.
half of the girls from my high school posting quotes about mental health bullied me
Can you believe that freshman year of high school I was bullied by two ugly ass girls because they thought I was flirting some ugly boy that they liked
He looks like the bully in a movie about a British boarding school
i hope every girl that bullied me in middle school/high school is doing good
But yeah...Letâ€™s hear the WH bully schools into opening. #NotMyPresident
Me: Mom a bully is picking on me at school. Mom: Kill them with kindness. [Drops bully in a well and fills it with jelly beans] Me: Be careful not to eat too many. I know you have diabetes.
STOP TRYNA SLIDE IN THE DMS OF THE GIRLS YOU BULLIED IN HIGH SCHOOL
(though in the episode Fight!", school bully Dwayne is wearing a T-shirt which clearly displays the logo of the British progressive rock band Asia and Spike was seen wearing a Smiths T-shirt in the "Big Dance" episode)"
And to everyone saying that he is wrong for mentioning that women also bullied them, grow up. I hate the patriarchy as much as anyone, but as a girl I know how mean other girls can be too. How many tears did I shed in middle and high school over mean things my "friends" pulled?
*She sat down next to him, a sigh escaping her lips* When I was born, I inherited something called â€œheterochromiaâ€ from my dad. My eyes were two different colors. So, when my mom sent me to school, I constantly had bullies telling me about how much of a freak I was. +
The police shouldnâ€™t behave violently because theyâ€™re the POLICE. Theyâ€™re supposed to uphold the law, not break it. Theyâ€™re acting like school yard bullies. Itâ€™s pathetic.
time to test it on your high school bullies/enemies. LOL
Saw this tweet that said â€œall them girls that bullied in high school are now nursesâ€ BIIIITCH if that ainâ€™t the damn truth why yâ€™all so amped to help out now?
My last points of reference were as a kid when I was stung in the neck and when I was swarmed at school bc a bully poured pinapple on my hair and they refused to let me was it off in the late spring (Catholic School) And it hurt then a Billion times worse
The stereotypical homophobic high school bully whoâ€™s secretly gay but itâ€™s me hating on France because I wish I were them
@TheDemocrats and the "I don't care" @gop Against our better judgement, we let #DonTheCon bully us into opening the economy too soon. It cost us 142,000 dead. Now he's bullying us to open schools too soon. 285,000 dead? trump is not the answer. Red or blue, #VoteBlue2020 #SaveUs
She's amazing for one, but most importantly, she's bridging the gap between genres. I saw her live and honestly the best part about it was seeing the type of girls who bullied me in high school liking the same dark shit I like
//Still can't rp at the moment. At work.
The girl that bullied me in high school just named her child after me. Perspective people... perspective.
I was bullied all through school. From about 4th grade on. In high school, some girls who were supposedly friends of mine spit lots of teeny pieces of gum into my hair. Took mom and I many many hours to get it out without cutting my hair. I had cis het parents.
I didnâ€™t go to high school with yâ€™all so I canâ€™t speak on ur drama from then, but it honestly just looks like u trying to bully one of the most positive people Iâ€™ve ever met over shit that happened so long ago? Just keep it to urself cuz u look foolish
The girl Vaush had on his stream, the one who talked about black nationalism, Vaush pretty much bullied her on his stream and I want that to be known simply. Dude antagonized her and itâ€™s worse with context.

Known as a high-quality human company, Five has bullied a little girl for so many years. Long-term cooperation hurt her knee injury, grievances dress up old-fashioned. Now the fixed station is next to it. Even the photos are only close-ups of the legs.
I get most of the backlash about that netflix show with the tall girl but all the people hating on it because "shes tall and white shes not getting bullied" is stupid. Imagine being in high school and being over 7 feet tall, and a girl. People are gonna make fun of you.
After pushing it a bit too far, the girl prepares to transfer schools. Upon hearing the news, his friends who also bullied the girl are now bullying Shoya. 6 years later, now in high school, he feels outcasted and is alone. Slowly, very slowly, he begins to open up to the world..
Sorry to hear that Luca's having a hard time with bullies. Had to deal with it for years myself growing up, to the point where I wanted to move schools too. It mightn't feel like it now but, speaking from experience, I can promise you &amp; Luca things will get better

I have literally said no to doing girls hair that bullied me online in high school
just saw a high school bully in some crispy air force ones i hope they CREASE she's a bitch to this day
Itâ€™s some moronic version of those kids in school that would bully people by saying, â€œHit me!â€ while pushing them back and yelling in their faces only to eventually get hit and cry foul. And if youâ€™re genuinely protesting, get out of the way of the cops to grab those people.
All of the girls who bullied me in high school are in sororities now and I justus think thatâ€™s funny
I donâ€™t even know this girl but she bullied me in high school.

High school bullies: Mfana be o reng maobane?
I had enough trouble being bullied by girls our high school toilets. I didnâ€™t need the boys joining in. Not that I think they would have, they would just have been mortified at sharing a space with sanitary towel bins.
If i could bully high school me....omg
I got teased in school but it was by other black people. My bully in middle school was mixed + he teased me for my hair and wrote "ugly girl" on my locker Black girls always had something nasty to say about my locs I had at the time, especially when I wore them in Bantu knots
Just found out that the girl who bullied me in high school got arrested and jailed for 6 months. For stealing cars with her meathead boyfriend. Yes, that one, the same one who broke her own arm and pinned it on me. Its been like 7 years and I still don't know how she did it.
HIGH SCHOOL FCKIN BULLIES.
Iâ€™ve gone from weighin 210lbs in February 2018 to 149lbs today, have completely changed myself physically and have people who use to bully me in high school asking me to help them get fit/stronger, and girls starting to notice me, yet Iâ€™m still not please about my looks yet. :(
Went to school with these girls. They were in the "popular" crowd at my middle school and the high school I went to my freshman year. Idgaf if people make fun of them because they would've bullied me in a heartbeat if I wasn't so invisible in school. Go off on them
All the girls who bullied me in high school are fat now
Its the intellect of the school bully.Cummings leads the way with his three word slogans and Billy Bunter carries the theme on with insulting rhetoric
me: girls who bullied me in high school:
BOOP, now go cry fed. Ouchie the water bottle hurts through my ballistic helmet and plate carrier. Just like every bully in school, they're fucking babies. I've seen less dramatic reactions in soccer.
Donâ€™t think this just happens to girls. I was bullied by male coaches in high school and I hated it while the girls had fun during sport. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m proud of that hard work but it made me a winner and taught me adversity
I was bullied terribly by two girls in high school. My art teacher once hid their bags in the ceiling cavity and fist bumped me on way back to the front of the room. He was the only teacher to ever stick up for me... even if it was in a weird way.
Funny how the girls who bullied me in middle&amp; high school AND told me to kill myself are the ones preaching suicide awareness now...why werenâ€™t you preaching awareness back then instead of pushing me to the brink of suicide?
When a girl who bullied you without mercy in high school slides into your DMs to ask if you have a few minutes to talk about a â€œnew health planâ€ that has changed her life...
Ok but like I literally got bullied for this in high school girls were WEIRD
some of you Hot Punk Girls who make chainmail jewelry werenâ€™t ugly in high school and were bullied for being one of the very few women in a LARP and it shows
Like what is the point? Basically high school bullies running businesses knowing lower class folks rely on that website

This will always be apart of your life, girls like me bullied you in high school now you pay me to do the exact same thing.
How I resisted bullies in school â€” Eboserenmhen, AAU graduate in wheelchair
AWAE AU!/SOCIAL MEDIA AU! Anne is not a girly girl at all! She is in her own world when she starts creating. After she graduated high school she wants to become an engineer. There is being bullied by boys but also meats some that are braking doors into her heart.
A kid on a school field trip, private citizen. Adults decided to ruin his life on social media, bully
U guys musta spent ur middle school and high school days being tormented by jocks and bullies. Throwing u in lockers and trash cans like gumwrappers! U guys will never have a life! Good luck, losers!

Some young American smug with social deficiencies. You are the kid in high school who roots for the bullies and laughs at the victim for being cringey. You are in the ballbark of collin and pokkst.
I know this girl that was bullied in high school for being fat. Few years ago she had a really dramatic weight loss and everyone was super proud. She bragged about it in her Instagram every week and even became a amateur Fitness model.
@rebeccakschulz I only wish youâ€™d get a bit angry! Quit sitting silently as your colleagues continue to act like a pathetic pack of high school bullies. I for one am angry! Iâ€™m sick of listening the knuckle dragging goofs with whom youâ€™ve chosen to align!
teaching your bullies a lesson by shooting up your school is pretty fucking sick ngl

once again I am reminding you that if you don't like my alumna post on my college's career center instagram we are no longer friends (I did not bully my school into being better for four years not to get 100 likes!)
Iâ€™ve had no luck in my romantic life either, I was bullied a lot at high school and â€œwasnâ€™t allowedâ€ to date the popular girls, I thought I might find someone in college but they all had boyfriends or were quite a bit older than me (1/2)
Sociopaths begin as gangs of bullies in school.
I STAN ok in high school, I was bullied by a popular girl all the time, and the one time I did the most non-violent thing and flipped her off, she assaulted me in the locker room calling me a dyke and the school didn't really punish me for it, but acted all disappointed
Jason Leitch talking sense on Breakfast Beeb. He's aways on point and never flustered unlike those englandshire experts throughout lockdown. They always looked like they were waiting for the school bully to slap the back of their heads.
Prove it . You a . Insulting people is a thesis for third grade school yard bullies. This is a big boy (18 voter age) conversation. Give twitter back to daddy and go back to your Xbox.
At least 7 of the girls who bullied me in high schools went into a nursing program and I know that because they heavily discussed it while beating me
lol this is the weird lonely girl that you bullied in high school this is what college did to her bro
I was bullied for the sound of my voice. In junior high the rich jocks would call out my name, in a high pitched â€œgirl voiceâ€, just bc I didnâ€™t hit puberty until my junior year of high school. Iâ€™m still self conscious about it.
mean girls from high school becoming nurses is the equivalent of boys who were bullied in high school joining the military
People ignored me in high school except for a few girls. It's almost worse than being bullied to be ignored. I like how Jo-Jo Siwa is against bullying. The popular girls at my shcool I really don't care for, and do not accept friend requests.
Some nurses were talking about that video where the stripper fell like two stores and one of the guys goes â€œthey make good money, huh?â€ And one of the girls says â€œbut they have an expiration date ;)â€ whew nurses really WERE old high school bullies
I just be thinking of the girl who faked as my friend and bullied me in high school and other people let her cuz she was light skin and I was dark skin.
Even my high school bully has bigger balls than Reggie.
Yes our fcking borders! Only two country's all over the world didn't sign the agreement over EEA and see boarders and guess which is the one. Have you ever consider that there's something wrong with your behavior? That if we are a child you pretend the bully of school?
I went to high school, and I started getting bullied because I was very weird. I mean, freshman year I went to school in a pirate suit - I just didn't care. I'm not like the cool girls - I'm the other girl. The one that's basically a nerd, but proud of that. Lele Pons
... I don't know... Isha sighs. "I mean... It's a big thing in high society when rich girls like my mom end up being single parents. Mom was unable to get married and my grandparents hate me. I couldn't go to any of the schools in my neighborhood because all the kids bullied +
Saw it all the time in high school. Never got why tall girls were so relentlessly bullied. Napoleon complex is a real bastard for high schoolers it seems.

I truly hope the girls who bullied me in high school who are having little girls never have to experience them getting bullied
He has given the promoters the all clear to continue. He just wants to destroy / bully/ threatening and kill the "little guy". Perhaps he was bullied at school, who knows but he shouldn't be an MP that's for sure.
I can talk about my dream to own a house without first talking about my middle school bully Jordan. And yes this was in the New Kids on the Block era.

Iâ€™m that girl that wouldâ€™ve bullied you in high school, only difference is that you now pay me to do it - and you beg me on your knees for it. $end
Tied would he my physical education teacher throughout grammar school. He was an absolute bully that enjoyed chastising &amp; belittling us students whom were not as physically fit as he desired. Mocking took place in the gym &amp; locker room. Anxiety evolved into to panic, &amp; PTSD.
Girl I did not get bullied in High School crying in the bathroom almost everyday from being called a faggot for these bitches to just joke around with the word
Lol some girl who bullied me from elementary through high school came in sat in my section with her parents. All Iâ€™ll say is the apple didnâ€™t fall too far from the tree
Also, got bullied in high school by girls. Most of my life, i was bullied by girls. Hardly ever by bois. ;_;) i was anti social, but they made sure they didn't like me. I do not hate girls, because of this. However, this does stop me from talking to girls. Ahah. I'm a loser
Older people are quick to say that a parent didn't hit their child enough if a younger individual is outspoken, then turn around and hypocritically chastise school bullies who mirror the same beating sentiment they adopted from their parents. You #boomers are confused.
About a year ago a young girl who Mained Isabelle beat a high leve competitive smash player. Then she was nearly bullied out of the community.

Bullied for being black. Bullied for being white. Bullied for being taller than most girls. Bullied for being built like a linebacker in high school. (Lol)
I just remembered a high school thing. Principal's daughter was the stereotypical favorite girl, spoiled and never got in trouble. Bullied. (She did/dealed drugs too.) In the school play (she was given lead role 'mysteriously').. 1/3
... i cant even disagree bc jessica is the name of my high school/college bully who is white and basic
Intramurals, first year high school. I was practically bullied to the point of admitting to a girl in my class. I hated myself so much that day. I get flashbacks of it and wake up in the middle of the night. So anyway, I knew I was ugly back then. But I didn't know HOW much.
I went through a huge ordeal in middle/high school where I was bullied for liking "childish" things and forced myself to stop liking them. Now that I'm in my late 20s? Girl I'm gonna buy all the plushies and play all the games and read comics and no one's gonna stop me.
Why does this remind me of bullies &amp; cliques in school? Bullies with their bubble of bootlicking sidekicks. . . . Because they are exactly this. Trying to save their ass by being proponents of fake positivity. Sorry can't fool us #BoycottAliaBhatt #JusticeForSushantSinghRajput
a:A MANDATORY talent show?!? b: Bullied nerd sings a verse -&gt; suddenly accepted at all parties c. Love interest whoâ€™s never talked to you invites you to 1-on-1 skinny dipping d: All the mean girls are blonde e: Small-town high school teaches Sartre so lead can say deep things
Then again, many of these people are literally high school bullies.
In the past even more so. All those wealthy childless godparents whose names pop up in my tree: Foley and Tuffnell for a start (in my work in progress Tuffnell is shortened to 'Tuff', which I rather like, even if a child so christened today might end up the school bully?).
Does Don Lemon have any ratings? I watched his show tonight and he sounds like and angry middle school bully. Or maybe a Mean Girl with a â€œburnâ€ book.
Threw some color on the Rita sketch @KorpsPropaganda did to try and nail down her color scheme! I imagine that as a kid she was bullied for being a boy with pink scales and went full hot girl to compensate. Also, did I have an obsession with Lisa Loeb in high school? Yes.
acting like the nazis didnâ€™t take inspiration from the gas chambers used to clean â€œfilthyâ€ mexicans coming into america daily for jobs or school in texas

The online bullies whipped themselves up. One, I found, lived in my hometown, NYC, and taught at the local high school. After a brief exchange where she said I was "a racist liar" I called the superintendent and expressed my disappointment. Hope she is well.
Francois, ever the frustrated, never made it to be a school bully, fails to be anything other than a complete and utter cock.

that moment when your elementary school bullies slide in your dms &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I LOVE IT
So the girl who bullied me in high school and who I thought was my friend goes to U of M with me.... If you're reading this I have such better friends and+
Also me and @LuminaryLeah weâ€™re the best friends and Sophie reserved the mean popular high school bully for @madisunemily
also you can see where the girls in high school that once bullied you are wanted or spend their free time stealing underwear from the mall but whatâ€™s it to me? quality entertainment
I hated them... I wanted them to be leaked. My friends that were bullied got rejected. We recorded girls, I am now 29 Years old. I did bad stuff. I got drunk, and got high. I went to jail for 3 years.
Wait, is Buck a high school bully, or am I? Just looking for some clarification.
I just put myself in an awful mood. Find out a girl that bullied me hard in high school is pregnant along with like 3 other couples that got married after me &amp; my husband did. I know itâ€™s not a race. I just really want to start a family already.
I remember back in High School, I used to be bullied a lot for my voice. My voice was (and still is) deeper compared to other Girls in my School, thus began a tirade that I was actually male because of it. As a result, it's manifested into me greatly disliking my voice.
The girls who bullied me in high school still buy there panties in packs
Schools. Sad when the one being bullied is always the one getting in trouble. Schools stick up for the bullies and the victim is left feeling much worse... Iâ€™ll die defending my boy!
What about the teachers? How many kids need to die before it becomes unacceptable? Get a spine and do what is right instead of cowering behind Trump. That will be your legacy of shame. I don't care of schools feel that it's safe to open, just don't bully them CDC &amp; White House
Years ago? He's a narcissistic, public school big head &amp; bully, (albeit it'd be easy to knock him out etc.), who regularly refers to a couple of prominent Brexiteers, e.g. Digby Jones &amp; Mark Francois, as fat, dumpy etc. I despise O'Brien.
Nengi can lie for Jerusalema ikayalami . She said she fainted all through her secondary school days from jogging, We that graced the walls of federal Government colleges in Nigeria known for bully and worst no faint like that #BBNaijia2020 #BBNaija #Erica #Wathon
just thought about the time I was being bullied/targeted by a staff member back in high school and I EXPOSED his ass in a very long, very strongly worded email to the school board and faculty. yeah girl I've always been messy it ain't just for twitter
These girls bullied me in high school, even earlier for even liking @justinbieber because â€œhe sounded like a girlâ€ &amp; was â€œfuglyâ€ so that made me a lesbian..
Our schools need people who truly care in them and, in my experience with public education, theyâ€™re few and far between. I donâ€™t plan to bash students in the teachers lounge like a lot of teachers I knew growing up. When the teachers are the bullies itâ€™s hard to make a change.
P.s. Never feel guilty for telling teachers & for getting bullies in trouble. Theyâ€™ll try to pretend they were joking to get away with it &amp; to make you feel bad, donâ€™t fall for it. I also think bullies should be removed from schools until they can learn to behave themselves.
girls who bullied me in high school are imaginations now and im ladybug
jessica? You're the type of girl that bullied me in high school
I was bullied by both races in high school. Wasnâ€™t black enough but wasnâ€™t white either. Even my light skinned black cousin was bullied by the black girls for not being black enough....
this is like when u find out 5 years after high school that the girl who bullied you for being gay lives in socal and wears matching Birkenstocks w her gf
was looking for a coworker earlier and almost asked another "hey have you seen x, you know works at the desk looks like the girls who bullied me in high school" and that's where it clicked why i suspect she doesn't like me
Itâ€™s not funny to get bullied I am autistic Iâ€™m in the middle of severe and non severe autistic. Iâ€™m low function and a bit high to. I was diagnosed at the age of 7. They say itâ€™s very rare to find it in girls then boys. It usley comes out in severe non verbal. I was lucky.
i had a dream my middle school bully came to my house to bully me some more ??? no thoughts head empty pls donâ€™t come to my house

Same reason people kissed the school bully's ass in grade school: To get stabbed last.
Isn't he one of the ones who thinks it's a splendid idea to send kinds back to school? Dudes a bully himself.
//I KNOW, I HAVE TO REPLY TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY DMS! I WILL REPLY FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP! (Morning in Belgium, not in America) Sleep well, my dear sluts. Your Queen and Bully loves you and your cute asses.
In grade school, you learn that peer pressure is bad &amp; wrong. But when you get to college, your professors &amp; classmates bully you into thinking that peer pressure is righteous &amp; good. Peer pressure is wrong. Has always been wrong &amp; will always be wrong. Period.
This is what happens when you go through high school being bullied and get your "mean girl" phase online.
We didnâ€™t have supplies in High School but my track coach thought he could bully me into pole vaulting. I was like, â€œ Didnâ€™t I tell yo ass Iâ€™m not pole vaulting?â€ But I do think itâ€™s an amazing feat when done my those who have perfected the techniques.
How do you stop notifications on Facebook where itâ€™s like â€œso and so invited you to like Nails by The Girl Who Bullied You in High Schoolâ€?
good to know the girl who bullied me in high school is still a racist pathological liar
I used to be one of those girls IN HIGH SCHOOL. Literally felt that way because I was bullied by them and after turned into a bad friend when it came to friendships with women. Learned from it and fixed it. Women who say this, they are the problem! 100000%
if youre a girl your nosejob makes you look like a nursing student who bullied people in high school. if youâ€™re a guy it makes you look like you play fortnite
People love to mold her into something she isn't. From the moment she was introduced to Arya's eyes people assumed she was the worst even though it was a ploy of GRRM to encourage critical reading in us. Sansa isn't that pretty girl in high school who ignored or bullied you. 1/2
2 sides to every story. What drove this young man to do such an act? Was he bullied by that girl and he decided that enough is enough? Is he a bully? We were all in high school once. This thing of being emotional regarding such issues is concerning. Root cause yalenyewe yintoni?
Told shawty imma bully tf outta my kids before they start school so that way they not fazed when it actually happens

It is SO DANGEROUS to open schools with NO FREAKEN PLAN just an ORDER from the BULLY-in-CHIEF!
the bullies, you might see people not saying anything to you or not helping you as monsters who need killing too. Some people may have just sat idly by and gotten shot for doing so. But, I dunno, I'm not them so who knows, maybe the entire school was cunts. And yeah, he was made
why are girls that bullied me in high school trying to add me on facebook??? fuck off
No I won't empty the dishwasher, I have school, you retarrrrd!
I had an unusually large cock and in jr high school was bullied and made fun of. Even some of the girls would make fun of me even though they never saw it.
Story Time : One upon a Royal High day a little girl had many great things. Her sisters friends were very mean and bullied the small girl. The little girl had to pay these people SE boots, a parasol, and 70k just for them to be nice to them. The end. Iâ€™m the little girl.
why is everyone so mad about this â€œtall girlâ€ movie, like no one said that sheâ€™s oppressed or anything, itâ€™s literally just another movie about someone getting bullied in high school, this is literally on par with EVERYTHING netflix produces???
i used to get bullied a lot in school for being too pretty they called me â€œpretty faceâ€œ they were like â€œoooo pretty girl letâ€™s bully herâ€œ and they would be like telling me shit like â€œoh your face is prettyâ€

Currently watching #DonLemon on #CNN #news. What an idiot! Heâ€™s making fun of #PresidentTrump like a grade school bully would to a student. Maybe you should learn some manners before you sit behind the camera!
Ok I used to have a thing against hives and monsters. But I think swifties are the meanest. Why you gottabe so mean. Oh I see, y'all a bunch of high school cheerleaders and you think you can bully everyone around here. If your fav is doing fine, just chill. NO NEED TO BE SO MEAN!
LMFAO I just came across a YouTube video of a girl I used to go to high school with exposing people from my high school bc she thought they bullied her but she was the real bully HAHA I am dying rn why does she make this video 5 years later Haha wow ppl really don't grow up

His bullies in high school
the girls that bullied me in middle/high school are now peace and love preaching hippie bitches who act like theyâ€™re the embodiment of all things good and kind and i just find it ironic. at least iâ€™m a real person
I got bullied for having a disabled sister and because I cut my hair (pointless reason) these girls I was good friends with through first and middle school then we go to high school and they all turned on me, I got threatened, beaten up, things thrown at me and called all sorts!
i was bullied by some of my teammates and one of my mentors for being the gay girl on my high schools cheerleading squad :) and the schools response was â€œmaybe cheer just isnâ€™t for youâ€ so i didnâ€™t cheer my senior year because of it
Furries be like: "God what a hot jock, i wish they would bully me in the locker room" And I'm just like dude, get real. You haven't been to the gym since high school.
Oddly enough, more people than just me donate. You seem very triggered over a little girl getting medical treatment for a heart condition. What happened to you? Bullied in high school? Small pecker? Both? I'll bet it's both.
Done right, exercise in school can open minds to a lifetime of skills development plus learning about yourself and others. Instead, itâ€™s bullies, favouritism, and maintaining the school pecking order.
how can toki have any confidence when he looks like a nerd i'd bully in high school
Did straight and/or closeted boys bully you a lot in High School?
I do not let bratty teenagers bully me. If yâ€™all wanna pick on me, yâ€™all gonna see the dean in school.
How on earth did you think you could credibly call me a child and go on to Tweet this B-movie, football team bully, middle school level taunting.
But fr fr why is public health being politicized and avoided by NHâ€™s public servants? I expect better from people who bully vulnerable students who already have more to lose than Julia not being able to send her kids to daycare. Or high school.
The marriage of being bullied in middle/high school and being a witty bisexual has turned me into a REAL mean girl, but for good

The girl who bullied me in high school I slept with her dad while I was in college. The catharsis is real.
Yes, I hated it in grade school when the bullies would be all "reclaiming my time" when I'd try to talk over them. also imagine going to someone with "Trumplican" in their bio for sex advice

Might Guy would beat up your high school bullies then invite you to come have a meal with him and Rock Lee and I love him for it
This might have more to do with reporting bullies &amp; kid-to-kid assaults that anything else. With all that is going on, kids are being assaulted in rising numbers in our schools, particularly whites. I've seen some pretty unnerving videos of teenagers ganging up on 1 student.
That video oozes "we bullied girls in high school" energy good god.
all these girls i went to high school with are posting the black squares on instagram i just find it so hypocritical because they literally used the n word daily and also bullied all the poc in the school hmmm so which is it amanda?

I feel like my high school would have bullied the fuck out of a pageant girl honestly, deservedly
Xbox bullies the other systems and software after school
Yeah, and every girl I ever dated in high school was bullied for being Dutch in Holland.
Kinda been thinking about trying to talk to girls again but ya know, got bullied for about a year and a half in high school when all these small town kids found out I was talking to a girl so now Iâ€™m like ehhh. Men are trash and I am a possum.
When I was bullied in middle school and high school, not only did I have scripts prepared but my mom would practice sarcastic response role play with me. IDK who is hating on being prepared but this former Girl Scout doesn't play around.
All #MAGA men are failures. Ever see a #MAGA parent? They bully the boys, objectify the girls (if poor, which most are, devalue them) Trump is master- his junkyard dog sons bullied entire lives. #DamagedMAGAMind
I feel like all you need is a bomber jacket and youâ€™re looking like a high school heartthrob , stick me in a tracksuit and I will be the school bully
A girl who bullied me in middle school thru high school added me on Facebook. Hard block. Her and a few other girls put me thru so much emotional trauma and 2 attempts at suicide why the fuck do you think you should be my friend. GtFO
The other night I seen the high school reunion one
I went to school with a great bunch of girls, many friendships still 50yrs strong. I was neither bullied nor bully. About 10yrs ago one of those friends told us she was badly bullied for being 'introverted' in junior high, we were oblivious, are horrified. Please speak up.
Every single mask bully in my timeline invariably has tweets supporting these densely packed mass gatherings in the streets and opposing the reopening of schools... every. single. one.
Brain dead. Blm is like school bully if he start to push and get put down end of probleme. But blm pushed and people got scared now a nothing feels like something.
Cannot believe the utter SHITE im seeing on here for mental health awareness week from girls that LITERALLY bullied there way through high school and still to this day will rip the shit out of you for enjoying yourself on a night out. The absolute HIGHT of disrespect

Luca it honestly feels like hell during the time but everything passes. School is over before you know it. Play the game of school politics, once you leave you never have to see your bullies again. Find strength in your strengths and hobbies and the ppl who love you. Xxxxx
old school, and run into these bullies in the office. They look terrified like they have seen a ghost, and utter â€œomg we heard your bones melted &amp; you were deadâ€ before sobbing and profusely apologizing for how mean they were to me
I got bullied in High School for Being Gay and all the Girls wanted to Hangout with me not Them.
I was literally 6ft tall all through high school and was never once bullied (to my face anyway idk) because I was a Big Bad Bitch and people in my grade/below were scared of me and the older grades didnâ€™t give a fuck so. Tall Girl isnâ€™t that realistic
me seeing girls that bullied me in middle school and high school for being gay, well before I came out, on Tinder is fucking wild
I wish I bullied more of the white girls in middle/high school.

She appears to be saying that when a teacher suggests failure to exclude racist bullies might have something to do with racist bullying in schools, it's a trick and should be ignored.
It's nice to see high schoolers get disabled students crowned for homecoming and prom king or queen but in my school they nominated a girl that was bullied frequently as a joke...
always had a black tool, even when i was at school coz bullies aint bulletproof
deadass every girl who bullied me in middle school either dropped out of high school, started doing hard drugs, went to jail, or got knocked up. what can i say besides L
I was bullied at my girls grammar school for being a â€œsquareâ€ and wanting to learn. I taught great children of all abilities who wanted to learn in a High school (within a selective system)- Grammar schools donâ€™t prevent this kind of bullying any more than any other kind.
Omggg 1. I did not want to box a girl yall 2. We were high af 3. She bullied me into boxing her 4. This is was too funny 5. I apologize for that again
Yâ€™all do more damage than you think youâ€™re doing. And quite frankly, if my bullies told me to get over how they made me feel. I 1000/10 would make them feel the SAME FUCKING WAY they made me feel ever since middle school. Iâ€™ve always told myself Iâ€™ll never be good enough for any
Girls from high school gotta stop tagging their dads in IG pictures....you bullied me Iâ€™ll fuck ur dad
Dreamed I bullied the assistant of a fashion designer into going on a TV show where he had to eat vile food. Then I took finals in a mall with a girl from high school who wanted to kick my ass and my friend Karyn. Then I was Fantine in Les Mis. With Harry Potter and Dumbledore.
I've always found the stereotype of Chad hilarious! We had a Chad in high school he was a skinny loser who everyone bullied. He was also too much of a creep so most girls didn't like him... I can't imagine a Chad the way they're normally supposed to be perceived!
Someone posted a video of school memories to our 20th Reunion FB page. Almost immediately, one of the Mean Girls posted "I was hoping it'd show our favourite teacher" - an inoffensive drama teacher she &amp; her bitch friend bullied mercilessly. Some people never leave high school
i wonder what all the bullies from elementary school doing wit they life rn
This may lead to social anxiety where one of socially bullied, feelings of helplessness, worthlessness, inadequacy, under-developed psychological and emotional maturity, engaging oneself in high-risk behaviors such as substance and alcohol abuse, self-harm
I just matched with someone who used to bully me in middle school.. And the audacity..... Like idk all I remember is the mean ass names you used to call me .
This a million times over. Some of the worst people to bully me for being overweight in my school career were my PE teachers. Oh and the whole "man up that didn't hurt" bullshit can get in the bin too
5/5 that life you claim you have. Act like adults and not middle school or high school bullies. Y'all are gonna push someone who is mentally fragile over the edge. TT already did it. It doesn't need to be done to anyone else. Grow up and knock the shit off!!! 5/5
Lol did a middle school bully ghost write this?
Not good hate bullies my son was bullied for 3-1/2 years then one day went nuts at school with a hockey stick boy they fuckin knew not to do it again. But school did not act in my sons favour

I assume you mean Mosman High school (itâ€™s not a girls school) where my kids go. There are disadvantaged kids in that catchment, check the census. The school also takes many kids who have been bullied out of local private schools for being different (eg LGBTQI+)
owning my middle school bullies who called me gay by fucking guys AND being straight
girls who bullied me in high school are juices now and im ladybug
weâ€™re reliving high school trauma #PS4live Bully Scholarship Edition http://twitch.tv/saturninesun
This shirt under dress style would've been seen as extremely tacky and got girls bullied in the past. This was a loophole created by high school girls that got tired of being dress coded for boobs, shoulders and collarbones
And you guys are the wannabe in the world school who can able to get famous no matter how hard he try, so they start licking balls of the famous/bully kids to get some attention #india_suck_balls
NTA. Do I feel bad for his family? Yep, sure do. But he willfully, maliciously, and deliberately terrorized someone. I'm guessing he was a bully in school and always got off with "you don't have a sense of humor" or "I didn't mean it that way, why are you overreacting?"
I never got bullied growing up, but this one girl in high school made an anonymous instagram page to post other girls' selfies and point out their flaws. What she said about me turned something I had literally never even noticed into the biggest insecurity I have TO THIS DAY.
A lot of black moms were bullies in high-school and grew up to bully their own daughters lets not overlook that
19 year old white girl in my spanish class bullied me today as if the last time i took spanish wasn't when she was in HIGH SCHOOL like sorry i dont remember these words
Never really understood how parents could just drop their kids off at a public school as if it was A-day care and not be involved if they only knew what really goes on in a public school they would have cameras on their Kiddos!! Child abuse, Bullies pedophiles alarming
Hot Take #my200vsbutch200 is the same mentality Bullies at School would use against you. There are better ways to call out Butch on his shit, instead of empowering yourself by putting down others. That mentality is going to subconsciously carry on to other people.
OUCH! That was be a blast to go back to high school though! Except when I got bullied by this girl named Jenny Madden, what a bitch! Iâ€™d do anything to go back in time and fuck her shit up! And yes, iâ€™m intending rape. LOL! This is her if I catch her at a party
Dear Luca, bullies are just jealous of you for maybe your personality, intelligence, looks or popularity.Thereâ€™s something youâ€™ve got that theyâ€™d like to have.Donâ€™t let these nasty kids get the better of you.If they donâ€™t stop get the school to sort it
Now owning my middle school bullies who said I stunk by wearing deodorant seems trivial.
Angela stated in an interview that back in 2001, when she was a little girl, she used to get bullied at school for having a high GPA. It drove her to wanting to commit suicide in her bathroom at home with a CD player in her hand with head phones playing music in her ears.
no one is saying skinny people donâ€™t go through shaming, especially people with anorexia or just people that are skinny in general. but thats personal experiences of such shaming, family members, school bullies, etc. being small is still the socially acceptable body type.

To everyone who has worked or continues to work on a Star Trek related production: I havenâ€™t seen it. Iâ€™m sure you did a great job. I want you to stop because Iâ€™m a middle school bully who objects to your interests.
@newby_andrew @sickpics4ever dude it's fucking twitter not the fucking play school library fucking grow a pair balls
High school was really girls being mad that their mcm didnâ€™t like them and liked another girl so they bullied the girl
Sorry to hear that. I was bullied at school and itâ€™s utterly soul destroying. Tell your girls to keep their heads held high. Bullies project what is wrong with them onto others, in my experience xxx
seeing girls who bullied me in middle/high school when i was struggling with mental illness post about world mental health day always gets me feeling a type of way

hope the girls who bullied me all throughout high school and told me to k*ll myself multiple times are having a terrible time
I'm not saying you are wrong. I was confused on which bribe we were discussing. I will read up on it though, thank you for bringing it to my attention. I will say though that no matter what the announcement Trump made about school funding was a bully move.
That game is nuts. As a kid I had dropped my copy and my save corrupted. When I turned it on I had all the equipment and seeming invincibility. After this a bully at school threatened to beat me up unless I traded copies with him.
All ptsd is valid but I really doubt he has ptsd from girls bullying him in elementary school when Iâ€™ve been bullied all through high school and can vouch that the 14 years of physical abuse and sexual trauma ptsd wouldnâ€™t even come fucking close to the bullying.
Did you get bullied at High School? I am praying your mom gets help is she wants. Overcoming drugs in a lifetime choice. Alana youâ€™re such a beautiful girl and very smart. Been watching since you were a little girl doing pageants. My heart is so broken for you. Praying !
these are BULLIES THESE ARE HIGH SCHOOL FUCKIGN BULLI
My son's school was doing circumcision for his grade ndakaramba hangu ndikati achaita ega kana akura I'm glad about my decision
Grow up bully, are you 5 ? You cannot just raise taxes every time the legislature canâ€™t budget. Remove all tax deductions for children and put it into education, simple. When you pull funds out of public school to send them to Allenâ€™s private charter school - itâ€™s wrong.
Plus addressing bullying issues (even teachers are bullies) in schools Plus addressing sexism and eradicating rape culture Plus training mental health professionals to be more compassionate
I don't need to talk to you. When I talk about bullies in high school, I am not trying to make an analogy on Amaury.. "projecting"? Let it be, there is no solution talking to you, I learned that long long time ago.
Like she listens to her doctor. Money on the fact her doctor is actually a girl who bullied her in high school who sells her essential oils now.
fell asleep and had a dream abt one of my middle school bullies chasing me with a knife and threatening to kill me
@PBandJenelley_1 @memory232323 @classy_carmenm blunt?? you are the biggest liar ever &amp; a sorry ass mom..that's why people don't like you

Now on twitter you can find people supporting and encouraging school shootings because a transgender idiot indiscriminately shot up a school â€œbecause they were bullied â€œ they shot everyone they could, not even just the bullies and people think thatâ€™s great. Twitter is cancer.
I'm topper saare teachers ki good books me thi so they were jealous they used to bully me a lot In school I hardly had 2 3 friends:)
School yard bully. Lying about sales. Picking fights and not showing. Heâ€™s been doing that shit for AGES.
Netflixâ€™s Tall Girl is v unrealistic. Literally no one at my high school got bullied for being tall, all we did was walk through the halls menacingly and scare off the dumb males. The weather up here is fantastic
honestly you just have to bully them like popular girls in middle school bullied you. act as if youre NOT bullying them but its obvious you are.
Surrounding you with all my love and full support! You're beautiful inside and out. Like you, I was bullied from elementary school until high school. Mostly by girls then boys. I would come home in tears and wouldn't want to go back to school. Always here for you! BIG HUGS.
High school bullies
I quit dance when I was bullied out of it in elementary school. We were doing a song from High School Musical in my dance class one day and this girl found out and told the whole class to sing "we're all in this together" when I walked in the next day. Fuck that girl.
If anyone tells u they went to high school with me and I was a mean girls bitch who did cheerleading and bullied them they are TELLING THE TRUTH
@AOC speaks for me. Have had expletives hurled at me since I was a teenager. Bitch, Slut, Fatass, etc. From men in cars, school bullies, male co-workers, construction workers, strangers on the street, and on and on.
@RickSnyderNews You need to get on this trans bathroom issue before us parents decide to home school! Don't let #POTUS bully #Michigan
2 DO NOT bemoan Edchoice this yr for ur own kids & then turn around & scold/judge/bully other parents 4 needing to engage in school choice decisions every year. Everyone is supporting ur familyâ€™s &amp; childâ€™s Ed needs so please have the decency to reciprocate bc now you know. #abed
Its funny how the bullys in my school glew down and the people they used bully glow the fuck up and thats on karma
Yâ€™all bullied big girls in high school just to turn around and start â€œweight gainâ€ journeys now. We didnâ€™t forget
He was a high school kid. Geez. These people just crazy? When did it become ok to bully children? Ohhhhh. The hat makes it ok? They are crazier every day. Parents. Pay attention.
last girl looks like someone who bullied me for having bushy eyebrows in middle school and then was like "oh my gawd who does ur brows" in high school
Both killed soo many they could not fill senior positions in factories, research laboratories, and graduate schools because everyone sharp was also independent minded. A problem at inception when anyone of ability in soviets(councils) was pushed out by Bolshevik bullies.
I wish I could go back and tell my high school self that all of the girls that bullied me would eventually hit on me at a bar during a global pandemic.
HAHXJDJCKDCK when the school bully coughs on the immunocompromised kid the school gonna say â€œweâ€™ll they shouldâ€™ve thought about that before they chose to be immunocompromised huh :-//â€œ
I had a marvelous time ruining everything was me in high school bullying back the bullies
Real talk: the girl who bullied me in high school has friended me TWICE. I've defriended her twice. Why she even tried to friend me is a mystery. She and a couple other girls would pick on me to the point I'd cry in the bathroom between classes.
I lost an eye when I was two because a relative threw a stick. I'm not positive, and they're all dead, but I believe my brother was given instructions to "toughen me up" It worked for a bit I was a bully in elementary school, and your typical jock in HS &amp; frat boy in college
you really do love tour elementary school bullies who wine, and cry, and head for the hills when someone stands up to them
girls who bullied me in high school are revolutions now and im imagination
Rebecca Black removed from school after being bullied by classmates http://n360.to/noc85c (via @news360app) #isitFridayyet
Wow u have the same hair as the girl who bullied me in high school
White girls who bullied you in high school be like "I cant believe the police killed that woman, so glad it wasnt a golden retriever tho "
@LaraSpencer @GMA @ABCNetwork What a pathetic excuse for an apology. You didn't just giggle, you shamed and bullied a boy for liking dance. It was like mean girls in high school. NO WAY you believe what you just said. Grow up!
i remember this guy tried to bully my in middle school and i told him to shut the fuck up and i was never bullied since &lt;3
Girls that bullied people in high school all have "good vibes" in their bio.
I wasn't made fun of for being goth in middle school just to see it trending now!! Bitch you're fucking 30. Please work through that everyone isn't your middle school bully, stop projecting onto these teens..half ur age. weirdos
I do get how dumb this is but also... My sister is a very tall girl and deals w a lot of shit for it and has been bullied a lot for her body so please just let the tall high school girls have this.
Why should private school students be protected from COVID while our government bullies public schools to reopen or face funding loss? The class warfare executed by this administration is sickening November can't get here soon enough!!!
Sure and that is part of why DJT is such a dirt bag, he loves to hurt other people for no reason other than to entertain himself. He has no class, no ethics, no empathy, and no morals. He is disgracing the highest job in the country by being a school yard bully.
Even if you aren't an outsider you're not welcome here if you berate people for their interests. Either stop acting like a high school bully or go to your little time out corner.
saw a girl who bullied me in high school while shopping and she said â€œyou look so good, you lost weight! way better than in high school!â€ and so i said, â€œthanks! i almost died and now i am having trouble recovering!â€ and it was the BIGGEST power move
You know whatâ€™s weird all the girls that bullied me in high school all had crushes on me!
Donâ€™t forget Belle for the Disney white girl who got bullied in high school
It scares me how accurate this feels and I didn't even have a bully in high school (thankfully) lmao
Seen comments from people who knew her at school say she was a bully, not seen anything in her behaviour to doubt their word. Leopards and spots and all that.
CARLAW the angry 2 faced who has no INTEGRITY is just like wee school bully hiding behind headmaster back because he is F- coward towards any real SCOTTISH CITIZENS and especially our FM
Stole footage from several independent webseries without permission or credit, neglected to blame people who were obviously at fault, didn't even acknowledge that one of the girls was a psychopath, and most importantly, boldly dared to ask "Was Slenderman bullied in high school?"
theres this person that used to bully me in school and now theyve had a job at almost every store in my town and every time i walk in and see them behind a new register, my fight or flight activates
If there was any doubt that the bullies in high school are those hired by the government. Hereâ€™s proof.
Itâ€™s so ironic bc the same people RTing about â€œcompassionâ€ and â€œhuman emotionâ€ are the same mfs that bullied everyone in high school. I really got people from HS tweeting that shit like they didnâ€™t LITERALLY drive a girl to kill herself. Disgusting.
Freaks me out to know Iâ€™ll probably never get past my high school bullies. Not a day goes past when I donâ€™t think about them
One of my partners in crime, who was a bit of a bully, accosted me before school, telling me that if I flipped and admitted wrongdoing he would beat my ass.
There is actual physical evidence that I've lost weight but everytime I look in the mirror all I see is the chubby girl who got bullied in middle/high school. I realize now that I'll never be able to love myself because I care about how people see me more than how i see myself.
The girl who bullied me my entire high school life popped up on my tiktok explore and now Iâ€™m pissed that she has fans but no one knows that at 14-17 y/o (me )she would harrasss me to kill my self :-///
@Rissuh123 awe! hahah how cute. i hate the mostttt when kids bully him, i seriously want to strangle them all. -___-
Atlas stops a school bully from teasing Olivia
he looks like he got bullied in middle school and became a bully in high school i can't explain
Let me run my "2/3rds rule" by you and see if you find it accurate.... Basically, there are 3 types of cops, 2 of which are dick heads. I'll expand... Type 1 - High school bully (probably jock) that peaked in HS and joined LE to have power over people. (Dick head) 1/2
In second grade, the school bully pushed me off the swingset, and my girlfriend beat him up.
His name calling is akin to a school yard bully. Her maturity in response shows how childishly Yoho Behaved in the moment and in his weaselly non-apology
Sheâ€™s the #bully on the school playground. But, sheâ€™s taunting the principal. But, sheâ€™s not a kid And the playground is a public street. And, the authority here - are the #police. Sheâ€™s about to experience a grown-up time-out. #LawAndOrder #RiotsNotProtests #BackTheBlue
the way 2013 harry looks like every bully in high school
Someone tell me why itâ€™s always the girls who bullied me in high school talking about spreading positivity and loving Jesus
@Tulane @LSU I really hope you wouldnâ€™t allow two bullies like this to represent your schools. Attacking a girl over mental health, money, and looks is sad. If this is how they treat girls on social media imagine what theyâ€™ll do on campus.
Put a finger down if u were getting bullied through junior high so badly that ur mom eventually got fed up with it and tracked down the IP address of who was sending you anonymous hate mail and it turned out to be the MOTHER of one of the girls on your cheer team the whole time
ion even fuckin know nigga getto school bullies
Yes. All 10 years of School, 3 different schools, on work places, educations and in the fandom.. I have sometimes had the wish to end in a car crash on my last job, so I could go home. Luckily now Im my own boss, so its only the dogs that bully me now
Next girl I see from high school talk about how they were â€œbulliedâ€ in high school Iâ€™m saying something in defense of the human beings that were ACTUALLY bullied. Half of these individuals WERE the bullies. No remorse.
my son was being teased at school for various reason, mostly bullies just trying to get to him. so for him distance learning is ideal. he learns better. he is less upset. but he still processing his experiences from school and a little scared of going back.
Whatâ€™s crazy is everyone wearing crocs as a trend but in middle school yâ€™all mfs bullies tf outta me
I wish I was back in high school so I can throat chop the girls that bullied me
This ain't school
yeah:D it was cool !!!! I printed it at school out bc its in free access
OMG I can't even begin to imagine how this poor child feels to be constantly bullied. My heart goes out to him & his parents I pray he stays safe; God bless him & his family & all other kids that are being bullied. These bullies must be stopped; what are the schools doing ?
The same reason you gave the bully your lunch money back in school
Are you kidding me? This kid deserves every penny of what he got. CNN and the bullies that work there need to learn a lesson for their blatant lies against a young high school man. The Wa Post and CNN wouldnâ€™t know truthful reporting if you hit them over the head with it.
@bonglez One day I wish a wealthy family could SUE the hell out of a Private school. Some of these schools are the biggest bullies. I also wouldn't put my child back in that school. @Radio702
high school bully greeted me happy birthday. i feel like i just want to send a thumbs down. HAHAHA
Bitches Like there was this girl in high school who bullied me and then we became moms at the same time so now she thinks we can be friends like go away lol
My mom has a girlfriend/long term partner when I was in middle/high school and I was bullied mercilessly for it. Had to leave that school because it got so bad. Iâ€™ll never forget finding out that one girl had started a rumor that I had sex with my mom and that people actuallyâ€”
The girls that bullied me in high school but now we close cause Iâ€™m flaming homosexual.
Trump said he would throw the first pitch at Yankees Stadium. They did not invite him. Heâ€™s also crying bc apparently Twitterâ€™s trending metrics bully him. Itâ€™s like heâ€™s in middle school.
Oh there was. I was also the girl everyone feared in school. Because I took on the Bullies everyone else was afraid of. If one can't stand up for the oppress they have nothing much to live for. Everyone needs a voice, I've just always be the one speak for those who can't.
When I was younger I remember vividly being bullied for having no boobs and girls using â€œbecause youâ€™re flat chestedâ€ as a comeback for everything. Now itâ€™s a daily struggle making sure I wear shirts high enough and always trying to not look so extra lmfao oh times have changed
idc if it happened in middle school or high school &amp; you're one of the girls that bullied me, wanna be friends now bc we're mom's NOPE CAN'T DO.
20/ High schoolâ€“ autistic girls often get bullied by their own *friends*/peers. The girl will not make a fuss in school. The Mask does not slip. Often parent reports it. The school ethos about Neurodiversity &amp; Disabilities needs addressing to reduce the *perfect student* ideal.
yâ€™all think its okay to bully ppl for liking mainstream stuff &amp; itâ€™s getting annoying! cut it out, yâ€™all sound like the mean girls in high school movies !
Every girl who bullied me in high school is now failing nursing school and selling shitty shampoo in a pyramid scheme
Fax dawg. I miss old fredo, Remeber the days when i could go back home from school and hop straight on yt to watch him, flight and cash. Now hes gone Hollywood. Wont exept the fact that hes in the wrong and would rather bully agent for speaking fax about the situation
Just came across the girl that bullied me in high schools Facebook. And all I can say is Karma is a bitch
So Trump abruptly cancels the @GOPconvention as #coronavirus cases surge, saying â€œitâ€™s not the right time.â€ But then he goes and bullies the @CDCgov into saying it is the right time to open schools. If something isnâ€™t safe for Donnie, itâ€™s not safe for Barron either. Or us.
in short we shouldnt let girls who bullied us in high school go to nursing school
Gianina is such a gorgeous looking girl! I wonder what evil kids bullied her for her looks in high school!
How I resisted bullies in school â€“ AAUA graduate in wheelchair
#theyestribe These moments of sanity amongst anger and betrayal and ineptitude caused by public school manipulators and bullies #BorisJohnson , #DominicCummings and #CCPLied are keeping me from punching people at the moment
Jim Jordon seems angry. His blatant arrogance is an attempt to disguise his ineptness. He acts like a high school bully.
Justly another snarky failed Liberal ... srly do you people ever grow up; or do you just send your whole life sounding like 16 year old school yard bullies
Maybe Iâ€™m just an impatient person but this movie was waaaay too long. The character development was solid though. The movieâ€™s about a middle school bully seeking redemption for his past mistakes. Itâ€™s about seeking forgiveness and learning to forgive yourself
These are bullies, these are high school fvcking bullies https://twitter.com/miaanji/status/1287876174824108033/video/1
high key one hundred percent of girls who bullied you on facebook in high school get super pregnant and super divorced VERY young and itâ€™s the weirdest &amp; best theory of karma ever man
//The plan is to break the eggs to make place for Van's babies. Yes, she impregnates the pokemons and forces them to have normal pregnancies. She is that fertile.
this holiday break ive come to the conclusion that im now hotter than every girl that bullied me in high school
It's sad that #RebeccaBlack's mom has to home-school her because of #bullying. Shame on the kids and adults for picking on a child.
This girl that bullied me in high school now has 3 ugly sons.... karma bitch
@CDCgov What the hell are you people thinking about school reopening! Don't let this bully jackass of a president scare you into doing something that you will regret! These are American kids of the future, teachers, parents &amp; grandparents in danger. You are losing our trust!
and in a twisted turn of events, the girls that bullied me in high school are begging me to join their pyramid scheme... iâ€™m sorry i just canâ€™t find value in you making money off of me working out? #DontWantUrFizzyStick
Camila Cabello seems like the kind of girl who would have bullied the shit out of me in high school
She looks so beautiful and sheâ€™s has a very kind heart . The only thing I can say is I was bullied to, but I was a shy over weight little girl. Hold your head up high sweet ness youâ€™re absolutely beautiful and they are all so jealous of you. I hope they stop very soon
Energy! Lols I intend on having 4+ kids for this exact reason. You can tell these ladies never had to worry about being bullied in high school. These the type of girls you know if you touch one you facing 5
Cha'la be that girl who says she wants to go into nursing cause she's super caring and empathic, but she has an entire side account just for racist towards tieflings specifically and bullied you in high school till you cried..
Taylor is so obnoxious, and I donâ€™t even know about the behind-the-scent shit. Judging by Câ€™s extremely racist post and other examples of her behavior in the past, Iâ€™m pretty sure racially bullied Black girls in junior high school
Keep more guns in the hands of children. It's okay to have guns in school. Go to school during a pandemic. Bully others on television, media, and online. That's the @GOP way.
I remember getting bullied by two girls in high school but when I defended myself for the first time I was told I donâ€™t respect women and had to get grounded.
I left Fakebook. May never go back. I tried so hard to save their lives, but they were more interested in petty gossip & lies targeting me & my family. Very toxic on there. Very â€œMemphisâ€ like school was. Bullies everywhere. I will tell the truth here. Xo
the ends of these brats never justify the means, any oppressive power will strive to punish victims for being victims while claiming victim. Typical school bully
The school is being a bully to you.
Unfair cried the school yard bully...No everyone is just plain tired of you and your dumb yes men!!! You've led them right out of their comfortable jobs one go all go!!! #biden2020
OK, so, itâ€™s 1984. A pretty weird time to be in junior high school. I know nostalgia for this period is pretty common now, but I really did not like this time of life. I was shy, nerdly, nearly friendless, and bullied. And, needless to add, had zero attention from girls 3/
the way i legit had to leave public school in the middle of 7th grade bc the bullying became too bad but now those same bullies are trying to become the aesthetic they bullied me for in the first place.
instead of a women tell all episode of #TheBachelor letâ€™s have an episode where all the girls sydney clearly bullied in high school say what she did
Itâ€™s the SAME girls that BULLIED me in middle school &amp; high school that always talking about â€œbe kind to peopleâ€ â€œhave a kind heartâ€ like OK BITCH.
Wow some girls shouldâ€™ve been bullied in high school cause they really think theyâ€™re something else lmao...
EDUCATION NEEDS TO CHANGE FIRST AND FOREMOST! For this little girl to say something like that,shows that there is a high possibility that she got bullied bcs of her skin or beauty.kids need a higher educational system and many teachers to be properly evaluated bf getting the job
2/ I transfered schools in grade 3 due to bullying. Right from the onset, I got bullied. By junior high ( gr. 6,7,8 ) it was relentless &amp; the hockey playing boys were the main perpetrators ( along with the girls who hung all over them ). It was hell. Pure hell
Jimmy Carterâ€™s Sunday School Teaching Days May be over
If your parents put you on birth control in High School, they saw the hoe in you early Kom Bully
Sam Wu is NOT a scaredy-cat (except he is). When a trip to the Space Museum goes terrifyingly wrong, Sam begins a mission to prove to the school bully, and all of his friends, that he is a fearless space adventurer.#SummerReadingChallenge
Kids get bullied by jocks and pretty in crowd girls. High school is rough. Dad did you ask daughter if she ever bullied nerds. Were you a nerd dad.
It made me think of the bullies when I was in school or former co-workers. Sometimes you give it your all, you give all the love you can and they just don't reciprocate it. I spent so much time wondering what was wrong with me and still do. But I try and be and do the best I can.
@TaranaBurke I don't think Bernie White Rebels know who they're dealing with. You will not be bullied into an automatic guilt because they're still living a lie. Only White girls accusations are heard &amp; even then it must be high profile $$
Girlboss companies remind me of the liberal straight girl who bullied me in high school
we all talk about girls from high school asking you to join their pyramid scheme but what about girls who bullied you inviting you to like their photography page... i get 6 a day i stg
@ABC2020 this chick that was bullied in high school seems mad cool now. Funny how things turn out. Sick tarts and nails girl! #ABC2020
i remember when i was bullied in high school when i was like 14 this girl made up a rumour that i watch gay porn and it still think abt it like what kind of weird thing to start is that
The way my middle school bully who threatened to beat me up if i hugged his EX girlfriend is literally praying next to me
Wait the girl who bullied me in high school is an RN now

LOL! Someone on Twitter posted a while back that they donâ€™t care to see pics of their high school bullyâ€™s vacation!
Don't let these toxic trolls get to you man. There is a reason they don't show themselves. They got bullied in high school so they make fake accounts to troll people. If you trust your girl then who cares man thats your guys business no one else is in that relationship.
How can The People help him? Schools have deep pockets. Portland Attorney Tom Booth in SW. He almost represented me when the lesbian bullies at Portland 911 made my life hell there. But this curvy white redhead Christian lady was not a protected class. I miss that job so much.
This girl on fb is always complaining and while I feel bad for her she bullied me in high school so
Why is it cool that girls are putting slits in their eyebrows now but when I did it in high school I got bullied
there was this girl who cyber bullied me in high school and she just followed me on IG... LIKE NO. GOODBYE.
yâ€™all really wanna know what character development is? Iâ€™m getting closer with this girl that relentlessly bullied me in high school and was known as a bitch by literally the entire town. sheâ€™s changed a lot and sheâ€™s actually super dope. oh, I also had a crush on her.
When the mean girls that bullied me from high school reproduce it really scares me
i was bullied in primary school for having no friends (THANKS AUTISM) and being fat and having acne since like, around 10 yrs old. then in early high school i was bullied because a girl thought i was a lesbian and also didnt like me for some reason?
bully for you then I guess. Nice to meet someone who loved law school but hated the darn bar exam.
The same girls that bullied me and many others throughout high school are now preaching â€˜girls should support girlsâ€™. Did you forget about that when you would comment this on my Instagram pictures? You made high school an unhappy place for so many people, do not forget that.
i know itâ€™s bad if you hold a grudge and youâ€™d think maybe people change but i will never forgive the group of girls who bullied my best friend for months back in high school.
sounds like you bullied girls in high school Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
dude my friends and I used to be relentlessly bullied in middle school/high school for being LGBT and tell me why I was surprised when I found out those girls who bullied me were all gay as hell
im getting bullied on tiktok bc a girl with a high following took my whole video bye.
Kids donâ€™t have stability in school. Itâ€™s a hotbed for bullies and indoctrination to anti America rhetoric! There is nothing healthy about the INSTITUTIONALIZATION of young children disguised as education.
i think the reason the Yes Queen Yes Mama James Charles Jeffree Star male gays annoy me so much is because theyâ€™re just the genderflipped version of girls who wouldâ€™ve bullied me in high school like theyâ€™re the Exact Same
Assumed gay (I mean they were right but I didnâ€™t know at the time), high pitched voice, being skinny, short, and always wanting to talk to girls more than boys because boys generally bullied and didnâ€™t want to talk about anything except cars.
itâ€™s the way he talked about twitter as if itâ€™s a high school bully for me
i saw a girl at wegmans today who bullied the shit out of me in high school and it was lovely to see her looking miserable
Many reasons. Primarily the country doesnt have independent economy. They are dependent on larger ones. Also u can bully citizens to send children to school and go to work but u cannot bully people to spend money and keep the economy going..
Real World: Bad Blood but donâ€™t watch it, that season sucked. It had a twist where like halfway thru their â€œbad bloodâ€ moved in. And apparently miss Kim bullied this one girl in high school. But she was barely on the show like she got zero screen time
The girl that bullied you in high school really be hittin you up when she needs peaches for her animal crossing island SMH
As reported today in the ultra-liberal TB Times: 1 out of 10 girls in Floridaâ€™s middle &amp; high schools reported being raped and 2 out of 3 reported being bullied...&amp; the report goes on with more disturbing data. Make no mistake, this result is largely due to the Liberal agenda.
it's like a high school bully, making fun of the unpopular girl because she's internally jealous of her
These were the type of girls that bullied me in high school lmao
My middle school bullies seeing me in the hallway
if this were high school iâ€™d bully tf outta her
A girl in my school district was being bullied so she put her period blood in cupcakes and gave them to her bullies (it didnâ€™t happen at my high school but it was nearby in our district)
so i missed alot of school days and events and stuff so its was probably like "that girl is pointless, she just is sick all the time. and was bullied in jr high gym for not shaving even tho i wasn't hairy and for being flat and not wearing a bra and was considered gross
MY HIGH SCHOOL AP GOV TEACHER LIKED MY FACEBOOK STATUS ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO BULLY NERDS WHO GROW UP TO BE CEOâ€™S I AM SCREAMING
He have the wit of a school yard bully #WhyIDontLikeTrump
I love seeing the girls in high school that were bullied for being the â€œhigh school hoesâ€ live their best life. You go sis!!!!
Yâ€™all got bullied by the mean girls in high school I got bullied by my mom, we ainâ€™t the same!!!
George something or other, 10th grade history teacher at Thibodaux High school, he was ignorant, a bully, and mean!
The reason children are failing in schools if Bc some of the teachers are incompetent unprofessional and hate children.Curriculum is not being taught.Kids have no self control they bully teachers.Never taught any Caucasian children ever.Not one. No learning going on.
Dreams were getting worse and my dad kept beating us every night. Teachers called me hopeless, Girls at school stayed away from me. Men at school bullied me. I thought I just had to crawl out of Jr. High I kept telling myself everything was okay and normal and I'm just dramatic.
All through high school I was called fat and made to feel that no man would love me. WELLLL now I gotta hot man whose priority it is to take care of his family and love us unconditionally. Not bad for a girl who was bullied through high school
LMAO IS THAT WHY YOU PUT HER ON THE LIST OF GIRLS YOU THINK WOULDVE BULLIED YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL
my brother still got his head stuck in my mums cooter fr they literally gossip n talk shit about me like high school bullies over the dumbest shit
Omg. I was a super skinny short girl picked on through elementary! Super nerdy with straight A's. Then in high school, still skinny &amp; nerdy, I learned to stand up for myself. A few arguments and fights later, no one bullied me again. I can relate!
A LONG time ago, some school bullies were chasing me, and they caught me. I couldn't run fast enough away from them. When they started beating me, I literally cried out for mercy. They ignored me. It was a milestone in my life. I now knew that some people were like animals.
Its obvious now we need to use parts of the school budget to give these racist bullies opportunities like paid trips to a theme park or sports events. This is in no way rewarding racist bullying as they have to receive an apology from the victim first.
Realizing how my middle school bullies really taught me crisis and brand management at such an early age
Bro tell me why I go to a coffee shop and see all the girls who bullied me in high school working on homework? Canâ€™t catch me here on a Sunday ever again
Being born & particularly raised in Africa. Attending American public high school just be be bullied by the African Americans girls/boys upsets me to find out Umar Johnson is using Africa as a way to get popular in the black community. I don't like it, and it just doesn't sit
either cus they're just genuinely mean, or because of peer pressure and not wanting to seem "uncool" by their friends, at least that was my experience while being bullied in middle school, had a girl be "secretly friends" with me because she didn't want her friends to bully her
A high school friend insisted on calling it Bully Butt, and it's hard for me to even say the actual title without snickering even now.
If I had time traveled from now to my high school self and said â€œhey, youâ€™re a girl,â€ high school me wouldâ€™ve been like, â€œhey fuck off Iâ€™ve been bullied enough today. Next youâ€™ll be telling me Iâ€™m gay.â€
indie now means to me the music the got you beat up in high school, which has now been adopted by the now middle aged bullies on their weekly shopping trips to Tesco.

Carrie (1974) Dir: Brian De Palma An unpopular friendless misfit and bullied high-school girl from an abusive religious household who uses her newly discovered telekinetic powers to exact revenge on those who torment her.
I think you must've been the one bullied in high school. I would've bullied you too, me and the girls you're disgusting
Being the new kid, for being Asian, and ESPECIALLY MY LUNCHES. I also got bullied because I was outcasted to sit at the â€œgirls sectionâ€ so I sat at the â€œguys sectionâ€ and ended up just being laughed at. For everyone who bullied me in elementary to high school, fuck you.
as much as I should be happy to see this girl finally be exposed for her true colors. high school you hurt, verbally bullied, socially humiliated, made up rumors to ruin reputations, or friendships, &amp;called us all peasants.. Iâ€™m actually just happy u said youâ€™re from Cali&amp; not FL
A girl gave cupcakes to her bullies with semen and pubic hair in them, we had a â€œfight weekâ€ the week before thanksgiving break where multiple fights broke out everyday within the week, the school mascot put on a Speedo with the mascot head and ran down the halls during class
Watching the girls who bullied me relentlessly in high school preach about mental health awareness makes me laugh. Fuck off you hypocritical cunts
people who never got over being bullied in high school are mad that thereâ€™s like 4 girls on tik tok who are nurses that seem mean. meanwhile almost every nurse i know in person is cleaning up shit off of people and being called a bitch while they make 1/15th a doctors salary lol
Was never bullied in high school, but middle school (6th grade) apparently I was a stalker. Remembered the name of the girl who started it the rumor too.
Just saw the girl from high school who got bullied for a year on http://Ask.fm for bleaching her butthole
Reminds me of the bully Conley joke about the odd kid with the school bag, getting pushed out the door. Spends the rest of the day stumbling forward with his arms behind him.
This is like the school bully crying because someone fought back
*runs into the girl who cyber bullied me in high school and flirted with my now-fiancÃ© (whoâ€™s with me)* Me:
I was bullied for basically everything, then it all ramped up after I was suspended from school for self defence. Bullied because I played a "girls" sport and not rugby league. Bullied because I ranked high in practical subjects and the list goes on
my bullies these are high school fucking bullies !
I remember when I was bullied in middle school and again in high school. And yes I still remember the white bitches who did it. I just hope youâ€™ve all got a taste of karma cause you bitches deserve it. I was always that shy girl who was afraid to come forward and do something
Grownups don't apologize to scumbag bullies who don't respect the foundational principles of human liberty. That school should apologize for creating an oppressive and intellectually and socially poisonous culture on their campus.
amber is a high school bully high school fucking bully
15. i was bullied off the ultimate team in high school bc i was short + a girl :') 16. ive never left the province and ive never been more than a 6 hr drive away from home 17. i have REALLY BAD eyesight and ive been wearing glasses since the 4th grade
I got bullied everyday. AND I MEAN EVERYDAY. These girls would make fun of everything I did. Throw ice and food at me. But when I retaliated, my mom whooped me and I got in trouble in high school.
Imagine coming on twitter and trying to own someone by telling them they would bully you in middle school. . .
Just found videos of me aged 4! My sisters bullied me and I was round! Cute
Tell me why you look like every girl that gets bullied in an American high school movie
Hard tti believe for new cause it was mostly girls who bullied me and it wasn't even like middle school, it was like when I was in high school mostly so it still hurts
my brothers girlfriend reminds me of the bitches i used to bully in high school
It's weird how many are near identical. They type only in lower case to make themselves look more childlike. And under the immature ' uwu ' anime-loving/K-pop obsessed/etc. facade, they're bitter and nasty like school bullies... at the same time as playing victim.
William Barr was a school bully at private school in NY, and his expression here shows his disregard for truth and the Congress of the United States. Throw him and the rest out.
This one girl who used to bully me and call me gay in elementary school ended up being lesbian
A few months ago a girl who bullied me in high school sent me a message saying I bullied her in high school I was so confused so I had to verify with my other high school friends. I was this close to apologising to her for what she did to me ayas zvakaoma
Boris Johnson seems to be intoxicated by the discovery that many voters - analogous to the playground disciples of the school bully - love the authoritarian nanny state. They get to share the dubious pleasure of the closet sadist.
And not the parents that raise the bullies? It's the parents that should raise their children NOT to bully someone who is different than them. I was bullied in middle school. By the time I was in high school, I was the one who stood up to them when they bullied others!
it's really true homophobic girls that bullied you in high school only grow up to be one of 2 things, nurses or pyramid scheme or peddlers
This so called president has shown again that he is a rasist he refused to pay his respect to John Lewis shameful but what can you expect from a grade school rasist bully president
I was a 6 foot tall girl in high school. I was also an androgynous looking closeted gay kid. I wonder which one I got bullied for...
Thereâ€™s this guy I used to bully in middle school &amp; I wanna find him so bad &amp; apologize for being a piece of shit
All the white girls that bullied you in high school are now Jeffree Star apologists
My first name is Hunter and Iâ€™m a girl and I was bullied for it all the way through middle school, but I think my sophomore year in high school is when I finally embraced having a unique name!
I was bullied a lot but I only had this specific thing when I was in high school with a lot of kids from a rich district and one time this girl was talking to me like you'd talk down to a small kid and I didn't understand why bc I've always acted even more mature than my age
The fact that the #AbLeg has become a ground for bullies shows just how lame the @UCPCaucus is. If this were to happen in school, you would be suspended. Laugh now, it's an act of desperation when you degrade others! Not nice! This is attracting who to invest in ethical oil?
I used to do this and some girl at school kept saying my hair looked nasty and greasy so I invited her over to my house to bully her and she cried and went home LMAO
GYM (I knew but he wouldn't let me watch) Jordan still has yet to answer for his failure to report the sexual abuse of athletes under his charge. Despite his juvenile middle school bully persona, (or maybe because of it) he is now the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee.
Top ones overpaid bullies. Lower paid, cowardly fascists? Possibly. Few old school left.
@tweetsof_yekaaa @MRLEELHB. Who you tryna clown you act like knew yo age wtf EAT A DICK #SWERVE YOU STILL RIDING SCHOOL BUSSES BITCH
Just thinkinâ€™ itâ€™s kind of funny how the girls who bullied me or others for being a little chubby back in middle/high school now look like the very girls they bullied... maybe you shouldâ€™ve minded your own business
Why is it that if a man says he had sex with a girl no one questions the validity, but rather, he is high fived and congratulated? But, when a woman says a man had sex with her she is bullied into silence and called a whore. PS suck iT Jake...
This is bullies beating up someone much smaller than them. They're the same bullies they were in school. One of my sisters knew someone who was joining the cops just to "bust some heads" He broke his knee before he could do so, and never became a cop.
Hey Luca, I was bullied at school too for being bright and different. Most of the bullies didnâ€™t get very far in life. All of them were weak, stupid, inadequate or unhappy in some way. Remember that and remember you have a dad who loves you and is looking out for you.
Itâ€™s just wild to me that all these girls who bullied me in high school are in my DMs ask me about either beach body/â€œmake money on socialâ€ pyramid schemes.
ITS BECAUSE HE LOOKS MY HIGH SCHOOL BULLIES THATS WHY iâ€™ve just never found him that appealing otherwise
A kid that used to bully me in middle school commented on a pic I posted asking who could get me a hair look for my wedding saying â€œgodâ€
When you acccidneltt get high and call a girl gorgeous on bumble and then realize that sheâ€™s actually this horrible person who bullied me in high school help me
I got bullied severely by these girls who I thought were my friends in high school and she basically told me not to take people for face value
was trying to type my last name and accidentally put fat ho (fatho) instead of fargo and realized middle school bullies missed out on an incredible opportunity
when girls from high school still think I am phased by them yeah, u bullied me for years, but I can assure u, u donâ€™t cross my mind bc I fought hard as hell to make sure I ainâ€™t got that kinda toxicity in my life. I have the best friends &amp; family, no room for u in my thoughts.
LOVE scrolling by a photo on Instagram of all the girls who bullied me in high school sitting a millimeter apart at forty thieves
Sorry if I donâ€™t have much trust towards people like you and herâ€” youâ€™re practically the spitting image of all the high school bullies I fucking dealt with..
Not just your personality. Your lies You taking Putin's word over your own intelligence agencies You sending an accused child sex-trafficker your best wishes You calling racists "Very Fine People" You calling people other names and talking trash about them like a school bully
Cw transphobia for some reason am awake and was scrolling thru the Venmo feed and noticed some girls from my high school that I was â€œfriends â€œ w/ bullied me like make fun of me and my girlfriend based off my Instagram in their Venmo comments lol. Fucking transphobes
come barista with me they just hired a girl who bullied me in middle school and high school and my favorite coworker is on vacation :(
5 Facts 1. I was bullied in high school for being a weeb. 2. I eat chicken at least 3 nights per week. 3. I have a University degree but have no desire to work in that field. 4. I've struggled with asthma my whole life. 5. I'll scream like a girl if a spider sneaks up on me.
I also had a school bus driver that didnt allow bullies. We had one kid who tried starting a fight on the bus. The driver pulled over and tossed him out, he had to walk about 30 minutes to get home. But it solved the problem. Alot of things of old days would be child abuse now
the girl who bullied me when i came out denied it &amp; was like â€œi wouldnâ€™t do that iâ€™m not homophobic i love all people and am always kindâ€ &amp; she brought this dude be nice campaign to our high school&amp; i think i still have some rage tbh
What the fuck #CanadaDragRace - why the hell were the judges so mean this last episode? Talk about high school bully fantasy, Queen.
Im always happy in school and miserabld at home. I dont interact much and ignore negative comments. I have a few friends and yeah. Ive had friends use me for money and i switched schools after that. Ive had people who would be much older than me and bully me for no reason
She is all kind and soft, but she has zero tolerance for bullies, at school she kinda got into fights a lot, but always for a good cause Once when she was about 8yo Werner took her out during the night as he gave her roller skates as a bday gift and she was eager to try them.
I got a girl pregnant in high school so I told my parents that I was getting bullied so we moved #relatable #highschool @BarackObama
Ok...stop it. I was that girl that was made fun of relentlessly. Bullied from 1st grade to my sophomore year in high school. Then I just got badass friends that would fuck anyone up for me. Please go back to posts I can be sarcastic to. I'm in my head enough.
yeah if yâ€™all ever catch me in this, help cause thereâ€™s something wrong lmfaoooo I would NEVER put on this â€œIâ€™m a straight Aâ€™d white girl who bullied all the weird kids in middle n high schoolâ€ outfit omfg
Don't worry schools have "his" back, they are shit hot on blaming and suspending bullies, he will have access to the girls' changing rooms from day one because he'll identify as something other than male. How proud mom must be.
Why did I let myself get bullied in high school by girls who followed the Common White Girl and Dory accounts and retweeted every tired joke
And this is your condescending high brow crapping on people giving their all for Sushant. No wonder you bully jibed me. Go back to school and get Education again. Shame on your cold.
To all you bitches that bullied me in jr. high, how does it feel to get pregnant in/ right after high school and everyone saw it coming because you were one of those girls?
Hey Luca, get yr dad to find you a karate boxing or judo teacher & the bullies will soon stop. My daughter was bullied &amp; her school did nothing when i told them so she got lessons &amp; bullying stopped as soon as she hit back. It may not be what people want to hear but it works.
sometimes I think Iâ€™m over being that little bullied girl from middle and high school but then I sit next to my classmates or coworkers and they ignore me and makes me feel bad and small all over again
Tragedy: Rebecca black forced to drop out of school because of bullying.
this is the uniform of the girls who bullied me in high school
Kinda sick of seeing the same girls who bullied me in high school on my fyp
These girls are the bitchiest girls in Bachelor history, they straight up bullied Alayah out of the house &amp; forced Peter to send her home. Yall wouldnâ€™t last a DAY at Our Lady of Mercy high school. No cap. #bachelor
Nope biggest mistake ever . 4 year college degree mandatory . Brute force bullies with low IQ will get us nowhere . If they are vets that's a plus but bachelors degree a must. Why should we be policed by pre college drop outs high school bullies ?
@realDonaldTrump hold the line, you are all that stands in the way of the School bullies and our lunches. Don't let the sucker you like Bush, McCain, and Romney.
this is dedicated to all of the girls in high school who bullied me for liking pink and cute things who are now e-girls on twitter with hello kitty avatars

Amanza is a babe. Romain is an absolute snooze, except when heâ€™s being savage. Christine is the worst, but in an amazing evil queen way. Heather is the worst in a pretty-school-bully way. Davina is the worst in every way, and WHY IS SHE ALWAYS WEARING THE WRONG THING.
My school bully was the DOUBLE of Junior 2 in this picture (even down to the sub-Deliverance inbred smile/sneer). For me, genuinely creepy.
playing a stupid mobage and the anime girls here are so mean i cant believe im getting bullied by high school girls again
â €â €â €â € â €â €â € iâ€™m just saying, it blows my mind that a 3rd year in high school still thinks is okay to bully an underclassmen for something that happened in the past. he learned from his mistakes and he came + â €â €â €
A mayor will need to roll up their sleeves and get into the weeds of how to make these things work. It means investment. It means using the bully pulpit and being a champion of trisector solutions for young people. â€“Saskia Traill https://buff.ly/32WztMn @expand_school
girls like this needed to be bullied in high school, i say this bc half of my high school thinks and â€œbelievesâ€ stupid shit like this LOL just say ur racist and move on
In middle/high school I was bullied by girls so believed love wasnâ€™t for me. I had crushes on many of my female teachers but lied to myself that it was only admiration. As I had my own laptop I watched the L word as well as films with (bad) lesbian representation.
Thatâ€™s because public schools are maligned as raising bad kids. If you eliminate all choice and only provide public schooling, youâ€™d be surprised how many bullies come from white wealthy families.
these girls bullied other girls in high school i just know it
BULLY! HIGH SCHOOL FUCKIN BULLY
School closures havenâ€™t stopped #bullies. Take for example this recent recorded incident on a schoolâ€™s football field where a number of girls brutally gang up on another girl. Sadly, many school districts donâ€™t take responsibility to end #bullying https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hv-hG7r_N0&amp;fbclid=IwAR2IL92GU_C7Qv91_mJ3hohlN8rU_Xq6Up7YFcv_mSbHOwIOkR7KgYu-jEg
a girl named mai bullied me in high school lmaooo
My old primary school bully liked my TikTok How ya doing
Every few days Iâ€™m reminded that the religious girl who bullied me for being bisexual in high school is now an anti-bullying advocate no way all of the homophobia is gone by now
u might know koe no katachi as a silent voice. ion wanna spoil too much but the premise is essentially how a deaf girl transfers to a new school and is straight up bullied for it &amp; fast forward to high school, the bully is kind of the outcast now and he tries to make up for+
not all nurses are the mean white girls that bullied you in high school, but all of the mean white girls that bullied you in high school are nurses
Social media is like a continuation of high school for bullies who never got their fill of doling out cruelty. At least if you could go back as a teen you could destroy them and not go to jail for it.
Cortez a hate crime against all men - feminist misandry from gold digger Cortez: She acts like a cry baby in the school yard, blaming the bully boy, using lies promoting herself &amp; motivating bias against the boy-this is an attack on all boys @POTUS @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi
Itâ€™s always well â€˜my bully in school drove me to suicideâ€™ or â€˜when I tell someone to kysâ€™ like these paper dolls are not real what do two anime characters have to do with your fucked up bully and/or you being a fucked up bully.
Yesterday I listened to Trump speak.. I mean really listened... Listenned to Hannity, Tucker Carlson Stephen Miller....So I have a few questions.. When did America become 2 seperate countries? Does anyone else feel like they went back to grade school an its bullies vs average kid
A little over halfway through Worlds Worst Parents. In the story just read, a kid is starting school where his mum teaches. Mum is excited. Kid says "can we pretend we're not related", breaks mums heart then gets bullied. Teachermum stops bullies. Yeah what a TERRIBLE parent.
not my high school making a post about black lives matter like they gave a fuck when i was getting bullied so bad i had to put the paws on this one girl and i STILL got punished for it lmao
I was bullied in primary and secondary high school. At the end of primary the girls have apologized to me but I will never forgive them but I have moved on and I never need to see them again...
I WISH you guys would abduct me. Be a lot cooler than this hellscape.

im always getting bullied by children on royale high because they think im a boy dressed as a girl
I identify... I was bullied out of high school in 9th grade. I was threatened with violence on a daily basis; mean girls who were jealous that he loved me... (Me &amp; the Coolest Dude On the Planet just celebrated the 33rd anniversary of our first date...)
Alex keeps sending me girls pictures and saying I look better than them (which i know), but forgets no one fucks with me cause I "bullied" everyone IN HIGH SCHOOL lmfao
PLSSS she dragged JUSTIN BIEBER youâ€™re acting like sheâ€™s a high school bully
New Study: High School Bigots And Bullies Emboldened By Trump
Lastly The crazy religious freak, Simboryo Girl who just made her second sequel for giving me nightmare. Sorry ka ghorl! May plano na ko nun LAST 2017: 5 guys in my high school forced me to strip naked infront of them, and when I luckily get away. They bullied me on social media
I see a lot of "people with small boobs are privileged. stop complaining." I was heavily bullied in high school for being flat-chested. Luckily, I've never cared about being a "real girl" because I'm not one. Cis girls still have to deal with the insecurity.
Not only hold that person down, but notice the goon jamming the baton into the ribs, making that person gasp and take in more gas. Did these folks train in terrorist schools? Or are these home grown bullies, doing whatever they like to inflict pain?
UM SO PEOPLE ON TIKTOK ARE LITERALLY SUPER NICE (I saw a video saying share if your not ready to go back to school or whatever and I commented Iâ€™m not prepared to be hated by my whole school because I â€œbulliedâ€ my bullies back and the person who made it asked for their @â€˜s :). )
The "Real Donald Trump" is not real at all. He is an overgrown under-brained School Yard Bully peddling his "bullishness" on America and much of the world. In less than 100 days, God willing, he will be gone from our lives --We hope and pray.
I was even in a fair few fights with fellow pupils myself. It was the kind of school that you had to choose to be a hammer or a nail. Couldn't back down or you'd become a victim and life would've been unbearable. Saw quite a lot of girls become the bullies punchbag
Gender criticals are the girls in high school who bullied other cis girls for being too masculine or something in appearance and now they think they're feminist somehow for doing it now lol
These are the girls who bullied me in high school
No argument is that they should be allowed to, because by using the girls bathroom theyâ€™re less likely to be bullied. Which of course is a BS argument. As anyone whoâ€™s been to high school knows
I'll send her to school and fight off all the bullies and give her head pats go away -3-
nah my therapist is cool but my general doctor kinda looks and acts like a girl who woulda bullied me in high school lmao. i'll have to tell her about it if i get approved bc she does drug tests so

high school. I know everyone has insecurities and all but biiiitch I donâ€™t remember u being bullied. You were even one of those â€œitâ€ girls and I can even remember you joining the squad of those who bullied me (they even have a name for their squad lol). Yâ€™all called me names in â€”
you are correct, I think people need to start when they are little telling them how intelligent they are and build them up, but then you get to school and bullies, and boys. It is like dominoes
The same girls that *tried* to bully me in high school for my natural hair finally done stopped hating themselves long enough to appreciate their own crown. Good for you sis
One time this girl tried to bully me in 5th grade. Then I gave her a horrible nick name (I canâ€™t remember it rn) and the whole class called her that for a whole year. She had the nerve to bring her mom to the school and say I was bullying her. Was I wrong???
I was the one being bullied in high school and am a nurse. However the girl who bullied me hard is also a nurse. Lol
I remember one time she talked about getting permission from her therapist to talk on twitter about how she hated taylor swift because she made sady think about girls who bullied her in high school
I've gone through your Twitter and you're nothing more than an angry High School bully with too much power. The protestors are using their 1st amendment rights, being silenced, attacked with weapons that are a war crime, and Ted Wheeler just saw who is truly escalating things.
the girl in tall girl got bullied for being tall but not by high schoolers, she got bullied by some toad of a â€œdance momâ€
bullyâ€™s high school fucking bullyâ€™s
Also cos I was quiet (aka social anxiety lol). And some girls in high school bullied me for my nice marks, boo sorry jealous btch. The only thing it's weird I wasn't bully for was the glasses, tho.
I remember in high school I would hear rumors about girls being sexually assaulted and instead of shaming the dude, the girl was shamed and harassed and bullied.
going to a new school this august and just found out from my friend that goes there his grade has a plan to bully every new student so iâ€™m letting my homies know and weâ€™re coming up with a plan
This guy reminds me of the psycho gym teacher in every comedy movie set in high school, the gym teacher is a psychotic bully but not too bright.
One of the girls that bullied me in high school just popped up on my tinder :/// Think weâ€™ll match??
Fault for letting it go that far in the first place, not the victim not the bullies but the schools and they're the ones that should pay but the killings of the bullies.
I guess the people who already shot up their bullies in school before this incident get to go free because they were rude to them in the first place! Seriously, just because it has a stigma on it doesnâ€™t mean people get to be excused from their heinous crimes.
Royale high is a toxic place now for you. Itâ€™s true I was harassed and followed into games by three girls they bullied me for a few hours until I stopped play Royale High
These *men are the bullies in our school who grew up to get paid to bully &amp; kill with impunity.
I lost my front teeth when I was around 6 ke bala 2 this girl would put her finger in my mouth and say ke mo lome ka lisene bc it tickles her if I didn't she'd beat me. We went to the same high school and I bullied her for 5 years straight because of that. Not proud tho
During the Clinton impeachment in 1998 I was 12 yrs old and got to intern for a state senator. I sorted mail and typed letters to constituents about why the senator couldnâ€™t fix their air conditioner. Middle school is hard for everyone, but the bullies were unrelenting that year.
Why is it the people you were NOT friends with in high school who were mean to you or even bullied you are the first ones running up like â€œOh hey, girl!â€ Tf? Last I saw you we were not friends and we remain not friends today.
Maire. These need to be normalised so bad. People in my school are literally outcasted just for having crooked/ slightly large noses, or crooked teeth and itâ€™s really sad that their outcasted for something they canâ€™t help. Iâ€™d get it if they were bullies or bad people (1)
Dying my hair, my guy friends, how I dressed, my voice/laugh, my interests, and jealous girls once I got with J. I was bullied A LOT and finished both middle school and high school in home hospital (homeschool through the schools with a doctor's request).
this is the reason i go to school and i proceed to either get bullied or bully jess
The girl who bullied you in high school
I know I shouldnâ€™t let my hater bother me. But when sheâ€™s my bully in school, it hurts painfully.
one time my cousin told me the story about how these girls wanted to jump her because she was pretty. She didn't say pretty, but it was because she was/is pretty. And she was a quiet girl in high school being bullied, and she beat that bitch's ass
RNC cancelled bec everyone too sick 2 attend!!!! He can do it on the internet and we can all watch him make a fool of himself! Would love that! There is no way he is going to bully us to send kids 2 school!
The opposite happened to me in middle school Well it turned out that in a decade I got interested in converting But Iâ€™m still denying those assholes the right to be right about me being Jewish so they could bully me
iâ€™m so used to food service and now iâ€™m doing reception at a wax place with a bunch of girls who wouldâ€™ve bullied me in high school LOL
The media should do anything possible to bully these AD's and schools into canceling the Fall sports, all growing evidence sports can be played and safely be damned!
Those #TrumpGestapo should be charged with child endangerment. These thugs were the playground bullies in elementary school.
I donâ€™t care about your high school bully :) good on him
I think she bullied a girl in high school or something and then liked a bunch of anti zigi tweets I think lol
People who went to high school with Tyra have already said she was a bully, Tyra HERSELF admitted to bullying girls in her high school because she got bullied in elementary so she makes a show where she can LEGALLY bully other young men and women and essentially hurt their-
Are you gonna apologise how you, @afarwen and your gang of bullies abused a cousin of mine and almost drove him to suicide during your time at Muhibbudhin school? All thanks to you people, heâ€™s still in therapy. I hope he has the courage to speak up. Itâ€™s his story to tell.
POV: youâ€™re a nerd, kicked to the ground, and the school bullies want their lunch money
Trump is like that one school bully that just wants to f*CK with you all day
not me, seeing the girl that relentlessly bullied and used me in high school begging for money on twitter everyday even though she wastes most of her money on weed. i love to see it
I remember in middle school I would â€œbullyâ€ (tease) some dude and the teacher would too lmao.
I would pay, and I do mean pay, money to see the two of you debate Kudlow. It would be like watching Mike Tyson having a boxing match with a bully from High School.
I recently got to know that the girl who heavily bullied me during high school still shit talks about me at her local university. And I said to the mediator who brought the news to me: Dogs keep barking but that does not stop the car from moving. And thatâ€™s how I knew that I won.
I just feel like she bullied girls in high school for liking anime then turned around and made it her aesthetic
I keep seeing these videos about Sydney and Iâ€™m just.... are people not aware that you can do a pageant and still get bullied? You can be the freaking homecoming queen and still be bullied by â€œfriendsâ€ every day. Yâ€™all already know high school girls are mean
RIGHT lol. itâ€™s terrible that Iâ€™m finally JUST now loving my body again & back to the confident girl I was before I was forced to attend hell aka Falcon high school lol. Iâ€™m seriously noticing a pattern, they only bullied the pretty girls or guys that didnâ€™t eat up their BS
Nothing like seeing my old grade school bully on social media expounding covid/mask "truth" about it being a hoax and teachers being selfish. Nice to see hes grown up into exactly what he was in grade school.
@mdna U are a ratchet old hasbeen. Ur so ghetto my dog than class than u do! U old saltine cracka!
i feel so bad for you i mean there were bullies in my school but at least they didn't bite me
I hear you on that! When youâ€™re a teenager. You donâ€™t want to be cooped up with a bunch of people, that are judging you. You want to be out enjoying your life! I hated school, and always skipped out on classes. Especially classes I knew had bullies. I was that weird kid, that (1)
These are high school bullies
dude i always thought i was gonna like... get bullied in high school like the mean girls in high school movies turns out movies and tv shows lied about the High School Experience
I'm not sure what to say about this. I'm about to go to high school but here's the drill: I'm usually the one that's getting bullied, I have never tried to get girls "wrong" (actually at all yet), and that thing with immaturity is only because I'm childish at times. So...
' yall mf so aggy man, always comparing cc to yall shitty ass school leave us tf alone WE ain't saying sh.t about yall.
The girl who bullied me in high school is friends with my mom on Facebook, thatâ€™s some audacity.
Then cancel your twitter account. You love it when someone says something good. You are a whiny grade school bully. Cries when anyone stands up to you
Is there some sort of lobotomy that parents undergo around 8 months into a pregnancy? ALWAYS run a name past an objective but creative third party! No matter how many rules against bullying schools make, the playgrounds &amp; hallways will be the same. Don't set a kid up for bullies.
1. I don't. 2. I don't think OA was saying schools cause racism, rather that by bringing kids together, some of whom enjoy bullying, &amp; not taking effective measures to prevent it, bullying (some of which will be racist, because it is hurtful which is aim of bully) will increase.

this is horrible! one of my best friends is a boy who dresses up as a girl in royale high, but iâ€™ve never seen him get bullied like this. hope eli knows we are giving him all our love. â™¡ï¸Žâ™¡ï¸Žâ™¡ï¸Ž
Hell no honestly, & well it was just weird bc girls &amp; ppl that bullied me suddenly acted nice to me &amp; acted as if literally nothing happened at all when it was later on in high school like what
The total girl next door type who bullied you in high school is SO hard to resist. What are you waiting for, dipshit. Pay your high school bully. #catfishfindom #catfishfetish #catfishbrat #scamFetish #ripofffetish #ripoffkink @retweet4catfish @RetweetCatfish @catfish_rt
Iâ€™m at a high school soccer game watching @mattmurphy64 ref and Iâ€™m so triggered. Every time a pretty girl walks by Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m about to get bullied
just saw the girl who bullied me in high school on hinge. deleting the app again.
all of my middle school bullies are now either pregnant or ugly
The Christian Girls Who Bullied Me in High School
ah so this is one of the girls that bullied me in high school bc i was â€œemoâ€ and now that itâ€™s the cool thing to be they try to fit in fuck off
COVID skyrocketing in the US and weâ€™re STILL talking about sending kids back to school. This countryâ€™s insane. But, hey, the past four years have only confirmed it. -_-
So about a year ago I met this guy at school and he told me about how he was bullied all through high school and he didnâ€™t really have much friends. Today I saw my boy got himself a girl a KING
Copy that! Talk about a flip flop. And school yard bully.
It feels like a deep seeded reason as to why most fans seem to hate blondes. Like they remind them of the pretty girl that rejected them in high school (guys) or bullied them (girls) so they always wanna see the blonde fail no matter who it is. Thatâ€™s how it comes off to me
YES GOD I got bullied a lot in middle and high school because straight girls assumed I was going to try to molest them, and now I'm 26 and get uncomfortable talking to literally any woman including friends because I'm terrified they'll assume I'm a predator.
Rebecca seems the type to have bullied girls in high school then preach mental health awareness #LoveIsland
she is so funny but i have trouble watching her videos sometimes bc she looks like a girl who bullied me relentlessly my junior year of high school im-
You're good lol and I feel you. What I wanted to say was, As a dark skin woman who has been bullied about my skin my ENTIRE childhood til I entered high-school by light skin girls I feel like sis needs to reevaluate. I'm happy people are finally seeing us as beautiful (why
Draya doesn't get her ass beat up enough & it shows. That light bright in high school who complains the dark skinned Blk girls bullied her ass headass bitch.
They weak as fuck They let people bully them and donâ€™t do or say shit but come light the school up Couldnâ€™t be me
I feel extremely sad for students who are in environments where they donâ€™t feel comfortable to move. Itâ€™s a real failure if itâ€™s directly caused by teacher input. Your point about bullies - a school cultural issue not just an in PE lesson one?
This guy I went to high school with posted on Facebook â€œwho knew evil girls have the prettiest faceâ€ and I almost commented those of us who were bullied by them in high school lmao tf
Hi Luca, Iâ€™m sorry you are going through a difficult time at school. My son did too. I want to tell you that he survived it. He realised that he was stronger than them. U can be strong too. Remember one thing. Bullies are weak people. Thatâ€™s it Luca, they are weak. U are strong.
thinking about how every girl who bullied me throughout middle &amp; high school has kids now... no fucking thanks
looking back at high school it was really only the bullies and sheeps that hated me which is actually such a flex
They arenâ€™t ready for bully ball lmao we bouta play old school
So many people I went to school with act like they grew up not being the bullies.. At least Iâ€™m running my own company, working a full time job, and raising my son all with 1 year of college. And Iâ€™m debt free. Damn.
And letâ€™s talk about how a lot of stan twitter insults are about coolness in high school or mean girl equse things â€˜sits in the toilets at lunchâ€™ â€˜gets bullied at schoolâ€™ yeah that happens to a lot of people especially people who find a safe space in fandom
you know that tiktok trend where people post what their school bullies look like now? i looked mine up and sheâ€™s an AMBASSADOR FOR THE YOUTH UN???? WHAT KIND OF SICK JOKE???? LITERALLY PART OF THE REASON I SLIT MY WRISTS ANd STARVED MYSELF LMAOOOOO
Take a step back and consider it objectively. Liberals, like bullies on the school yard, end up limited to one tool.. intimidation. Be wise. Aikido uses the force of your opponents energy against itself, but not reacting to it. These guy just dox the DHS acting director. #Breathe
Joe Rogan fuck you video game save my life when i was geting bully in school about my a.d.d and mental disability and now way the world is people kill humanity im sick of this shit
listen last time i played this was in middle school million years ago i can give him a chance now but i cant promise i wont bully him even more if it wont work
Because democracy doesn't care about your opinion. Stop trying to bully votes. It's as lame as primary school politics.
all the girls from high school who bullied me for liking 1d really wanna put the harry album cover on their story huh
It's the same as zero tolerance for violence in school. Bullies can hide behind a veneer of no violence and still torment the victim. The victim otoh is often forced to use physical force to stand up for himself, yet the system will strike down hard on him.
Why do you care? It has nothing to do with you! You are a mom of two girls! Be a role model not some stupid middle school bully!
I was bullied...chased home, jumped by some girls in high school. Ended up whipping the one that provoked the bullying ass. They all left me alone after that. Not the right way to end bullying but it helped me. Theyâ€™re all losers now. #karma
we pretty much don't know anything about ryan outside of his grief, tibo and nvq... and we know nothing about graham before grace meanwhile for yaz, we know of: five individual family members, career and her boss, school bully + struggles w mental health, her aspirations
My 13 yo daughter has had so much trouble at school, being left out, bullied and the final straw she was jumped by 6 girls on high street of town we live in. Thankfully a passing cyclist stopped it. Rarely goes out her room now. Hope things get better for you daughter
when bullies from high school just try to treat people with kindess bc itâ€™s trendy
You can tell all these guys were huge bullies in school
I bullied a girl quite badly in high school. In hindsight my behaviour was pretty textbook - desperately insecure kid who was bullied myself, bullying a smaller kid to hide my fear &amp; feel powerful. I've felt awful for 30 years. I looked her up and apologised in a FB message.
Iâ€™m exactly the same, I was bullied in school mainly by boys, for the longest time I knew I liked boys but boys were always so horrible and mean to me. My old friends were girls. I did have one guy friend in high school briefly, but I developed a crush on him and he is straight
â€œThose hot Cheeto girls who bullied me in high school are all nurses now!â€ tweets former FjÃ¤llrÃ¤ven backpack girl.
bro on GOD. school traumatized me i hated u bully ass whores and rapist ass boys ontop of insane magnet school workload ! ontop of EVERYTHING in my life why did they feel the need to make me even more suicidal w so much school work i hate haynes academy with everythint in me
Jisoo in these photos gave me popular girl school bully in a teen movie, and school emo/rebel mixed together and idk why i feel this way, but then i see the pink bunny eye-

OMG WHAT I THOUGHT WE WERE SORRY DJSKSKS i love ur vibes ur pfp has bad memories for me but just overall like, that one cool girl you see in the halls at school that everyone has a small lowkey crush on that u think would bully u but is actually so insanely nice
when you got bullied by white girls in high school
This is heartbreaking to the max. I cry for this child. Bullying behavior is our of control. We had a girl that suffered from the effects of polio that was bullied in Jr High. It stopped when a handful of girls went after the bullies. They were cowards &amp; backed off.
My high school bully became a cop and now she has a only fans and thatâ€™s kinda the growth I wanna see?
Sean Sherk, the bully in high school Sean Jerk
Itâ€™s cute and when the guy who used to bully you during middle school asks to take a shot out of your tits
Example: Sunset Shimmer. She was a villain the MLP Equestria Girls movie and NO ONE, not even the fandom, liked her. She was cruel, malicious, bullied anyone who got in her way. And was your typical high school alpha bitch and tried to kill our main heroes.
Ali Miller here from Los Angeles. I really felt like Dorinda was bully this season. I hated the way she bullied Tinseley than publically trying to shame Ramona. I am a high school teacher and I feky like Dorinda was a â€œMean girlâ€.
My mom is obsessed with caloric intake, fitness, and weight, but really only as it pertains to image because she was bullied as a girl, and my dad has a really high natural metabolism and worked construction 90% of his life and could eat 3k calories a day and stay thin.
That homely little girl is me...I graduated Pinecrest Woodland Hills (Elementary) in 1985. I was bullied the whole of my schooling...through high school. I'm tougher for it. It wasn't all bad. I have deep anger toward those that pick on innocence! â€“ at Riviera Mobile Estates
Full grown adults acting like middle school bullies
to every girl who bullied me in high school, congrats on your ugly baby
Barr was a bully and a racist in high school. Just type â€œBarr bullyâ€ into Google and read articles. Why is he Attorney General?
When girls who bullied you in middle &amp; high school tell you happy bday
One of the sons was a bully (to other kids at school and one of the younger siblings). Maybe the dad said something to the son then which he now regrets.
dan is very shy. if you ask him to do anything he will blush and giggle because as we have established his role in fics is parallel to that of the sexist damsel in distress character. one day his high school bully phil stops taunting him for wearing pink to give him a kiss
More like the school and teacher wouldnâ€™t want a lawsuit. There are teachers who donâ€™t like students. In 4th grade I had bullies, but the biggest bully was my teacher. That was the year I found I hated school and luckily my grandmother forced the school to switch me classes.
was bullied from first grade to Junior year of high school. My bullies picked on me for being the new kid, playing with girls, being fat, unable to communicate well, being a loner, other body issues, accused of being gay, being gay and because they were bored. I'm amazed i'm sane
@mattrox456 Matt, I nearly got taken away from my parents at 13, the bullying started at a very young age cause I was chubby and stuff
Dunno. It's just that I really enjoy my own company and because my hobbies are reading and watching you don't want to get disturbed, right? But i also got bullied during middle school and high school. Game changed in college. Found myself hanging out w/ boys a lot
these are my high school BULLIES!
It makes me so happy that all the high school girls that bullied people for being fat are now fat themselves. We all out here wearing the same size, what u gonna make fun of us for now sis?
girls who bullied me in high school are handwritten letters now and im juice box
In primary school this girl used to bully me because I had a dad. I hope she's alright.
How about the angle from the school (bullies) all he needed was to talk to someone, rub minds but no one was available for him.
There was the one time I considered doing this to my bully's car in High School
I was bullied for being fat in middle school and when I got to high school I met a girl and we bonded over both of us feeling fat and both started a diet and mine went farther than hers. Iâ€™m anorexic but I also struggle with binges
when i was in elementary they always bully the " skinny " kid and beat them up coz they look weak. specially if they are small. if they went to high school they always get called ( kites or bones ).... again body shaming is bad. fat or skinny shaming its both damaging
i heard she bullied a lot of people in high school around the time she was starting to do youtube... and that she was the actual real life popular cheerleader mean girl so maybe thatâ€™s why??
when i was a sophomore in high school this girl who bullied me gave a presentation on catcher in the rye and ended it by being like "so yeah at the end of the book he has grown out of it and is all better" and the teacher was just like "very good job"
I just wanna say real quick that I love seeing tweets about Nessa because she simultaneously looks like every girl that bullied me in middle school and half the girls I was friends with in senior year of high school. That is to say, she's great.
The tall girl in my year in high school was mocked a lot and her nickname was big bird. Itâ€™s hard enough being a teenage girl but tall girls are often looked on as a bit freakish and bullied for it. Seeing other women fail to understand that is annoying.
#NAME?
Whatâ€™s the most ironic thing youâ€™ve seen happen? â€” girls who bullied me in high school for being a lesbian talking about how much they love rupauls drag race nfjdjfjdjfj
Wouldn't know. Didn't go. I was bullied relentlessly in High School. School was a living hell. I still have dreams of running over, I mean running into, the girls that tortured me.
Victoria: idk why she cries so easy and looks like the girl that bullied in high school and became a nurse
anyone who got bullied in high school who WASNâ€™T a horse girl should be entitled to financial compensation
Iâ€™m WEAK!!! Not even close, but go off sis you bully your own boyfriend but thatâ€™s nun of my business. Iâ€™m suchhhh a bully, thatâ€™s why you stayed friends with me for so many years, and I defended you when you got bullied in high school lol and I was just a freshman
You know, there is validity in these small communities having concerns, regardless of their perceived wealth. Demeaning and name calling hashtags really doesnâ€™t raise the bar for respectful discussion. Everyone has turned into a middle school bully.
I had a dream that I was getting bullied (Iâ€™m 25 now so flashback to high school days lol) and @tylerrjoseph stood up for me, becoming my friend but also putting a curse on the girl bullying me ??? Pregnancy dreams are strange
TOURE JUST HIGH SCHOOL BULLIES
My bully has always found their way to get to me,, the one time he didnâ€™t come to school I felt a better about myself. But scared as shit coz I knew that the next day was gonna be 100 times worse as any other day
Itâ€™s funny how the same girls who bullied me for being bisexual and spread horrible rumours about me in high school are celebrating pride. Sis proud of what ?? Your homophobia and disrespect??? Your lack of empathy???? Check yourself.
The world as a school yard analogy. In one corner, bright kids trying to do their homework. Other corner, dumb obnoxious bully boy yanks girl's hair, laughs at the kid in the wheelchair. Hides behind his rich daddy. Hated by all And Australia wants to play with that one
Mc bullies someone in school, and tries to make amends years later
Suddenly all the white girls who bullied me in high school love black people and I just find that............. really interesting. Hm. I ainâ€™t letting you hoes off Scott free please know. Funny bitches I really donâ€™t give a fuck stg
i definitely believe that there should be more agressive and strict laws punishing those who Bully in schools. These kids are just trying to get an education!! #CRJ105
i was hangin out with a girl once and told her i got bullied and called potato head in high school and she didnâ€™t stop laughing for 20 minutes...i still think about it daily
what was I not bullied for? My weight, my glass, my strap to hold my glass (got the name grandma), my knocked knees (got Sasquatch and Yeti), and just me being the chubby fat girl from elementary to high school now I talk big shit and Iâ€™m a bad bitch so HA!
When the girls who bullied me in high school message me about their pyramid scheme lotion I just say yes and buy it. I am very much still afraid of you, Kaytlin Randecker!
bro you can bully the kids at school but you canâ€™t bully me mr i.t guy
MUA girls that probably bullied u in high school will wipe black eyeshadow all over their eye, draw a lil cross on their cheek and call it a â€œgoth lookâ€
Dear sweet girl. High school is a tricky environment! It can be a hard and unhealthy place; but only if you let yourself get sucked in to this! I was bullied at school A LOT because I'm just 5 feet tall! I used to get thrown out of stare cases and was called names! BUT....
Wow, making an excuse for rape and murder. Q: So why did you rape and kill that 2 year old girl? A: I had low self esteem and was bullied in high school. Q: oh, wow. I'm sorry. My bad. It's OK then. Please rape and kill as many people as you need to feel better about yourself.
The replies to this are hilarious... I bet every single man saying â€œwow it was 6th grade just get over itâ€ is one of those guys who bullied girls in middle school/high school. Men are the absolute worst
Rumors about Yuchiro began to spread around school soon after her bullies followed her after school and found out about her jobs. These rumors were eventually relayed to her dad, who didnâ€™t respond kindly to what he was hearing about her.
The girls that bullied you in high school
need to watch more movies where high school bullies are played by men in their 30s in backwards ball caps
Just found out that the girl who bullied me in Forth grade got held back in middle school, meaning sheâ€™s still in high school lol couldnâ€™t be me
Mad how all the girls who used to bully me in school actually just peaked in secondary school hahaha howâ€™s life still living off mammy and daddyâ€™s money???
very out of body experience to stand in a circle of girls and realize hm every single one of you would have bullied me in high school
Or even of items of other students??? how many bullies are going to start coughing on the items of marginalized students in their classes? Or straight on the student themself?? Schools ALREADY do absolutely nothing about bullying and harassment.
mom come pick me up all the girls that bullied me in high school are pregnant
Don't distract yourself ARMY they're just messing with us like those bullies in schools #MTVHottest BTS @BTS_twt
High School me is Joe Kelly... holy shit lmfaoooo

girls who bullied me in high school are highs now and im gnome
I am a white female. Every day in high school I was bullied by a group of black girls. I was pushed- shoved -had perfume - ketchup - banana shoved on me...I was tortured - they were mean because they were taught they just happened to be black. People are mean - people are kind.

Selwan being homophobic, colour me shocked! /s You know she BANNED talking about BL & yuri in that shojo chat she runs? She has definitely not grown up past the high school bully she absolutely was. LMAO all her fav shojo protags would probably hate her irl.
weâ€™d watch shrek in french with english subtitles at least once a term in high school and our french teacher was the spitting image of farquaad and he got bullied worse than a horse girl but still continued to let us watch shrek multiple times a year
One thing that keeps coming up, video after video, is where is all the hatred is coming from? The high-school I went to was integrated, and it was not uncommon for the black kids to continually harass and bully others, including the teachers... a lot. No apparent reason ever.
One kid turned into a leftist JUST LIKE my bully friend's kid. Why? I'm embarrassed to admit, I quit listening to Rush Limbaugh during school hours for that kid's high school years. (Middle son.)
why are so many stories set in high school targeted towards girls where they are "different" and often are bullied for it, but I can't think of any like that for guys? I can't help but think it victimizes women and makes us not trust each other.
It's odd you obsess over experiences in primary school like this. In richard dawkins autobiography he spends like, a chapter wondering why he joined in a group of bullies in primary school one time, so you're not alone in that xD

Kirsten Fleming was probably bullied by the pretty girls in high school so sheâ€™s redirecting her resentment towards CHD . This article was nasty, unnecessary and a prime example of shitty journalism. Be better. #DaddyGang
Kevin Walles, REMEMBER ME! Carlyle Deauna (from Matignon High School). You used to bully me back then at Matignon High School by calling me PIMP JUICE. Also, do you realize that PIMP JUICE is the equivalent of BART SIMPSON?
Yeah. Weâ€™re living the Dream. Massive unemployment. Rampant disease. A government that attacks the people. Trillions in debt. A so-called president who is openly hostile to the majority of the people and the world and is a lying belligerent bully. Have no idea if schools are safe
//MILFS at the end of the video.
I was bullied by two bigger white girls in high school because I was the skinny black girl that people could push around. One of them even followed me home and hurled slurs at me. No one did anything about it. Itâ€™s clearly a two way issue.
In Canada, Child Welfare oversees high-risk situations. Social workers are involved, but I am not aware of them getting to bully anyone just because a kid didnâ€™t show up at school a few times.
One wonders how many school security guards were once the school bully.
i donâ€™t hate sports because i got bullied for throwing like a girl in high school, i hate sports because of fascism
I am Hispanics in high school I was bullied by an African American girl till one day I said no more and stood up for myself later she and I became friends.
i hate that my school bullies are kinda pretty now like yeah theyâ€™re bitches for bullying me but i have a fan account for cartoons on twitter so whoâ€™s the real loser here
To the girls that bullied me in middle school and high school, I hope you fixed whatever issues you had and are living a better happier life.

it was was my oldest aunt...she was really close to me and would protect me from my brother when he'd bully me and help me with school as my mum didnt really care. she died from a blood clot in her heart. i miss her.
like it is simply not as simple as â€they are a bully bc they are a bad personâ€, children donâ€™t act that way for no reason. itâ€™s often a combination of personal/home life problems and the tense environment created in middle/high school
I feel like oomf bullied other girls in high school
Hey. Hey, you. You know that thing you keep hearing your parents or your school bully or your abusive ex say, over and over again, years after the fact? It was a lie.
Why do bitches who were rude to me in high school have â€œbe kindâ€ in their bio. Iâ€™m going to message and be like hey girl are u a nursing major cuz u bullied me in high school :)
every girl who bullied me in high school wore these ugly ass shoes !!! i may not have been cool but at least i wasn't wearing SNEAKERS with HEELS
The schools bully
3h gemini - empty middle school - was always in girl drama. involved in bullying others and being bullied. so chaotic high school - got rid of all the drama involved girl friends from middle school. had one close friend, but talked to multiple â€œgroupsâ€ of people
Bully is a bunch of KIDS at school and its literally called Bully. That game raised hairs when I was a kid. Social and political climate, not ready for this game.
Thatâ€™s because white people bullied White girls for being too big and such. I look back at my high school days and there were girls who were just thick with wider hips and more curves and they were bullied by white men in hs as the fat ones.
I got a girl pregnant in high school so I told my parents I was getting bullied &amp; we moved
She's the popular girl in high school who claims to have been bullied growing up.
When I think of high school bullies I think of the lady tiger coaches. They really were the ones that were doing emotional and mental damage.
1. Popular Fed up with being at the bottom of the high school pecking order, a boy swears revenge on everyone who ever bullied or ignored him. He believes that once he has become attractive and successful, the popular girl he lusts after will no longer resist his charms.
conventionally pretty girls love to say they were bullied in high school! maybe u were annoying !
If yâ€™all hadnâ€™t bullied that girl in high school for her attempted whistle notes Iâ€™d still have a â€œthe wayâ€ YouTube cover to laugh at (in secret) smh.
It's funny you put it out in the world and then cry when you get it back I have a hard time believing you were bullied in high school anything close to what a gay boy would be bullied Girls get the free pass and always have
I'm letting you dig down and reporting every bullying comment. Honestly, is this your life? Bullying online, or are you a bully at school too. I bet you are.
I'm not gonna lie, I was awful when I was in middle and high school. I slut shamed and bullied countless girls to be able to fit in and I've even spread the nastiest rumors because it made me feel good knowing nobody could take me down. But you're not invincible forever.
Oddly enough some of the best teachers Iâ€™ve had have been bullies. I saw one once flip a quarter across the room to a student and then tell him to go call his mother to get him, as he had no place in grad school. He was quite right in his judgment of the quality of the student.
You made a bully cry! Is that "alpha" for grade school? Lol
Thanks baby love you I have a handicap ; in high School, I was bullied on social media . I was a chill girl but because of that I was very depressed... thanks to my moral strenght, family and Friends, Iâ€™m better now. Hope youâ€™re okay. These losers donâ€™t deserve your atention
Watching many videos from my high school made me think. Ah, I really miss a lot of things in high school. Back then I was just this unknown girl in the back of the class, fearing I would get bullied
High school jock falls hard for scholarship/diversity student who is bullied by a mean girl who can do no wrong in the admin's eyes.
Police will pettily and childishly retaliate when mildly provoked isn't the ringing endorsement of law enforcement you think it is. Some of us have higher standards for armed officers of the law than we do for high school bullies.
Oh hell no, you mean to tell me he played golf, outside, and didn't wear a mask? And he gets tested every day. The thought of it makes me absolutely livid. The left is starting to sound more like middle schoolers at a private school for the rich trying to bully another student
Agreed, my PE Teacher bullied me which made the bullies in my class even worse, the whole thing was horrendous, a CofE school with no anti-bullying policy didn't help! Although I saw said PE teacher the other day and he is now the size of a house and hasn't aged well I call kalma
had a dream my middle school bully was a titan bye
This one time when I was 16 this girl I went to high school cyber bullied me bc I was excited that I tried sushi for the first time and she was like â€œI used to love in Japan blah blah blahâ€. Anyways, I guess it worked bc I still remember. Why red heads gotta be so mean.
Bollocks, mate, absolute bollocks. Lewis is a bully, full of himself. Remember what the bullies in your school, your firm, your gym, your pub were like? Saddos like Lewis Hamilton. Sad sad people getting their own back.
8th grade I joined the girls field hockey team as goalkeeper. I got bullied to high heaven because of that
Kids need to go back to school because being bullied by an older brother at home is no replacement for the true horror of a professional school bully.
this. this is what i meant. about all the girls that bullied me through high school / middle school
'Sticks and stones may break my bones But names can never hurt me. School bully?
If you're having problems with the school bully, try bribing someone.
I'd say they probably WANTED to be bullies high school, but were cowards and couldn't fully realize that desire until they had the title of police officer. They know they'll be protected with the title, but would face repercussions without.
When I got to school, I asked the school bully what it meant because I figured a bully would know the meanings of dirty words. He thought he knew what it meant, but later, I learned he was wrong. Sex ed on the street is unreliable. I have stories.
I am so sorry this happened to you and any other girl that was terrorized by his disgusting ass. For what itâ€™s worth, I bullied him in high school because I always fucking hated him for being an annoying gross ass fucking creep.
I knew a Muslim girl in high school who after Tr*mp got into office had to stay home for a week for HER OWN SAFETY she was SEVERELY bullied; and the school did nothing to protect her. It was so fucked up and I think about how schools never protect their black and poc students.
Oh yeah I cyber bully the fuck out of people. They tried to bring fat acceptance into police brutality. Then kind of made fun of this girl who said she was r*ped at our school. Itâ€™s messy af
Oh yeah I agree I bullied myself for about 20 years before I got out of it because of how much I was bullied in school it took me a long time to find the truth about who I was and to see that I was okay after all. I wasn't the problem it was the bullies who were the problem
5 facts I did my university degree online I studied piano, music theatre, &amp; trumpet before coding I was a mormon for 3 months I was bullied in high school to the point one girl tried to 'make my life hell' (her words) I came out as bisexual exactly one year ago
i'm so glad i went 2 a school with normal people and also bullies
random things that i can recite without being asked - all of circus baby's sister location dialogue - fernand's breakup speech - the "the VOLUME inside of this BUS" tiktok - the girl who bullied u in high school's vows tiktok - the steampunk twins tiktok - the g*bbie h*nna poem
The girls that bullied me in high school and middle school stay talking about being positive to other girls on social media haha fake hoes

Bowden is a perfect example of everything wrong with "Americans" and has been emboldened by trump to openly act like an ignorant elementary school bully.

All the girls who bullied me in Junior high for wearing docs are the same ones wearing them now bc theyâ€™re â€œinâ€ Tbh I want financial compensation for all of that trauma thx.
Today's autism awareness day, wild how the clique of girls that bullied you in high school took 5 minutes to know you weren't like the others while it took 10 years to professionals to mutter that you might have a case of the ass preggers syndrome.
My middle school bully used to call me j ro
I hate bullyâ€™s. They say once school is done with so are the bullyâ€™s and thatâ€™s a bunch of BS! They everywhere, in your family, at work, your neighborhood, when you go out. Only difference is now as an adult Iâ€™ll throw hands idc None of em can hurt me now
But you are causing harm. Outing someone's biological sex can put trans people in physical danger and deliberately misgendering someone can cause gender dysphoria for many trans people. It is also extremely fucking rude. Misgendering someone is what high school bullies do.
My old high school bully just tried to menace and harass me when I was walking in town. Just filed a restraining order on him that sheriffs are serving on him soon
these ade high school bullies
im still that weird girl you bullied in high school so donâ€™t try it now
Bill Barr is a classic bully and very thin-skinned. I think the public recitation of U.S. Attorneys, bar associations, and even his own law school alma mater saying he should resign and is disgrace to the profession *really* got under his skin
Just sad, pathetic, school bullies or victims of school bullies who don't know what else to do with themselves beyond terrorizing those they view as lower.
Freshman of high school. My mother just died. Teachers asked "Well, does your mother call you that?", and when I ask about a math problem in class (for the first time; I was always bullied, so I stopped asking for help) and a girl called me stupid, and my teacher backed her up.
Don't know about you the only cause I have is the opportunity to overpower the bullies. Just remembering high school and the fun I had with bullies. That's my cause right is right and I'm right
The girls who bullied me in middle school ended up hairdressers (there were only like 12 girls at my high school and none were bullies) but based on the people my (nurse) sister works with I can 10000% see the "really mean high school girls to nurses pipeline" as a thing
misss r came out as a lee's bIAN because the boys at nasa were picking on me after that girl gave me that valentines note she was telling me of her time being bullied at high sxhool
The cdc really let the president bully them into saying that schools should open. Interesting.
Heâ€™s the school bully thatâ€™s like â€œwhy donâ€™t I have straight Asâ€ but never shows up for tests.
#ThankYouLogic I was bullied in school constantly. I remember when "Under Pressure" dropped. It stayed on my mind. It brought me and my bullies together. We would always talk about how you're music was TRASH. Thank You Logic! You truly changed my life!
Iâ€™m thinking about watching BNA tomorrow, but at the same time Iâ€™m watching a anime movie that I want to continue tomorrow about a bully making it up to a deaf girl and making amends with her for what he done to her in grade school
At both of my new jobs theres a girl who bullied me in high school that works there
thinking about some girls in my middle (or high?) school faked someone asking me out as a joke &amp; i was so relieved a male wasnâ€™t actually asking me out i never realized i was being bullied
Trying to get back into hockey at Uni just reinforced that the school sports bullies had gone on to be uni bullies. Being plus-size got me filthy looks from all the weights posers and yummy mummies every time Iâ€™ve tried to improve my fitness at a gym, so I eventually gave up
I OG she is no messier than ALL the others. She has not lied, bullied, bashed, anyone. Jackie in all the business but OG need to go.....Plz OG and Cece made this season. Frfr! Tired of looking at Evelyn's lame ass. With her high school mean girl antics. Keep doing you OG!
Better Days twinning a melodrama in a chronically competitive high school in China and peculiarly guitless chronological love story centralizing a bullied girl student and small-criminal street-savvy trickster whom she mets looking for sophisticated future. #RekomenFilem
Every teacher I've had, from Sunday School, preschool, through grad school has been my favorite (minus the political math teacher, the bully program teacher, &amp; the one who was never organized to teach but would rather belittle).
girls who bullied me in high school are rats now and im romantic
Yes, why is that people call me an asshole &amp; Iâ€™m like whatever, but I see someone being bullied or disrespect and I go ballistic. Disclaimer, I was the school bully when young. I think thatâ€™s why it bothers me. Bc I had issues that didnâ€™t understand so I was mad at the world.
Another super-mature tweet from the GOP. What a joke. Youâ€™re all just middle school bullies. At least your one bully who got the shit beat out of him.
Can't believe one of the best guitarists in the country rn used to bully me back in high school.
anyone watching indian matchmaking.......aparna is like that girl who would bully you in school except sheâ€™s in her 30s
I had to make peace with my school yard bullies. I always find it fun when I get an @Facebook post from them. Full confession though......I turn a lot of those down.
When are you sending this one back to school. Here's a deal for you. Send him to a public school in the city of your choice for 6 months. If he makes it through the 6 months, then we'll consider sending our kids back. Lead by example, not by being a ignorant bully
The same girls sharing the video of the 9 year old Austrailian boy crying about being bullied.... Are the same girls that called me "It" and "Fat Whale" in Middle/High school. Miss me with your bullshit.
Just wanna thank my bullies in primary and secondary school I didnâ€™t forget that shit
Atleast she is speaking on the matter no like you busy in only bully others. You are free to do that as per your evidence but please look forward and speak up on what you should rather just fighting like a school child in tweets.
yeah, she's acting like a grade schooler and all the cultist friends who follow her are like her grade school bully friends
@Louis91Tom_ Omg I can't believe someone would wish that on anyone never mind a baby the sick bitch
Apparently pretty girls get bullied throughout middle and high school. Is this true?
What a POS you are for ridiculing a young girl concerned about the environment? What did she do to you to deserve such scorn and bullying? I bet you bullied special needs kids in high school.
Can all the girls who bullied me in high school stop posting about world mental heath day lol
heidi n closet was that one girl in high school who defended the bullied white gay
ngl my greatest decision was joining twitter because now I can bully you outside of school
I remember receiving the roses my friends got for me, but they never received theirs from me. The whole day kids were looking at me funny, laughing behind my back. After school I found out what the bullies did and that my crush threw the flowers out. Kids can be so mean.
O da, zaboravio sam na to. Imagine being all giddy and excited about magic and a bunch of racist bullies break your arms and piss on your clothes in your new school because your parents live in Liverpool
one time i walked into a lil restaurant and it was owned by the parents of this girl who bullied me in high school and she was working and told me to come back soon lmfaooo bitch you may have forgotten but i didnâ€™t
We high-five each other. Jimin has a smile on his face again. The girl, whose was bullied thanks us and she also run away. Â»Why did she do that?Â« I ask Jimin. Â»I don't know, but I think it's probably for the better,Â«he takes my hand, warm in mine.
Both my kids started at single sex high schools and both got bullied The girls were worse than the boys (expected girls can brutal) Pulled them out and sent them to mixed schools they were fine (they were both very smart and went on to university)
mfs from highschool rly sit out here and tweet â€œchoose love guys â€ â€œlife isnâ€™t promised â€ as if they didnâ€™t belittle and bully everyone relentlessly at school, and donâ€™t do rails of coke at frat parties now and s*xually assault underage girls ........ okay buddy
You're like a bully in second grade "school"
Wa wa your a school yard bully
I got bullied for dressing like a guy in middle and high school. Had remarks like, "LESBIANest" and got asked out as a prank by a group of guys cause I was "the ugly girl" I never let it get to me though. I just wanted to dress the way I wanted and flaunt it to the haters
middle school bullies were the worst bullies
my middle school bully just went skydiving
Being in your last year of High School is such an achievement and something that means a lot of focus, those bullies are focusing on the wrong thing and trying to sway our girls attention. @alicewillhelp has reset her scope Fashionista in your face! #bulliesbegone #Aliceskids
What? Can't answer me now you resort to memes? You know what you both sound like? You BOTH sound like school girl bullies who make shit up to BULLY a person and when your ass is called out YOU TURN THE TABLES and say it's a "joke".
Weak boys who got bullied in high school, who got massively rejected by girls and envied the jocks, become cops. When they do, it's a lifetime of payback for being overlooked.
Big Sean's "I Don't Fuck with You" - Kids Talent Show - Fist Fight (2017... https://youtu.be/L-bvse-sM7Q via @YouTube I needed a laugh from this. I can see my daughter doing this in front of the school bully.
Tell that to all the guys and girls who bullied me middle school and high school and ruined my confidence :)
I've spent a lot of my life afraid of befriending women because I was bullied a lot by them and made to think it was all one big practical joke and no one actually liked me because that's what most girls in middle and high school showed to me but I'm done with that shit now
My middle school bullies are ugly and poor now and Iâ€™m just here like
Someone please buy me new kitchen knives... these bitches more dull than the girls who bullied me in high school.

@AlyssaEdwards_1 looks like every girl who bullied me in high school
One time I was bullied in high school cause I tried to buy pot from this girls ex boyfriend. And that is the story of why I donâ€™t smoke marijuana.
no, theyâ€™re jackasses. donâ€™t let these schmucks bully you into changing your stance. my kids will be learning remotely. forcing kids to return to school while risk of infection is still prevalent is criminally negligent.
the girl that bullied me in high school
So youâ€™re saying you bullied in high school and the horse girl still had horses in her engagement pics
I got bullied for my natural hair, lips &amp; nose in high school. Then turned to getting â€œ youâ€™re the only Black girl Iâ€™ll date/ Pretty for a Black girl.â€ Not to mention the list they made of pretty black girls in reading. I cannot
Thinking about how fucked up it is that jr high school girls get bullied for not being sufficiently â€œhotâ€.
Iâ€™m not the same girl I was in high school, I used to get bullied by the same people who wanna be my friend now
A lot of them are random creepy men but then I have like every bully I had in high school blocked
yes, kinda like that. the title of the movie is tall girl, about a tall girl in high school being bullied for being tall.
My niece & her friends were being bullied at school &amp; the teachers were not stopping this, even though the bully was hitting them too.
a girl who were bullying me like 5 years ago left the school like four years ago cause inwas bullying her but she started and then everyone was like lori is a bully i dont like this story
the key point is societal. A trans teenager killing a high school bully isn't solving a systemic issue. and idk how just killing all the people who are ___phobic is queer liberation, there's way too many of them.
I work in a school where they hang a list of 20 different behaviors on how NOT to be a bully ! Leader dear leader made it to 33
Im pretty sure if i went to high school with my girl I would have bullied her
Everyone tweeting "this tweet/ your tweet/ your show?"
(5-?) know. Itâ€™s not rocket science. I havenâ€™t read much about the hate on Chan, so thatâ€™s what all I have for him right now. Letâ€™s move onto HyunJin rumors. What Iâ€™ve read so far is that a girl calmed he bullied her in high school and it effected him because of all the hate he
these are BULLIES. these are HIGH SCHOOL BULLIES
Sorry u were bullied &amp; I was bullied to in grammar school &amp; high school, I have a beer belly &amp; kids would say that I'm pregnant &amp; then by girl felt unattractive just by how they looked at me
The girl that bullied me in high school turned out to be close family friends with my husbands family. She texted him horrible things about me on our very first date and some how, some way was at our wedding
Jay-Z's high school bully: ur mom gay Jay-Z, 35 years after said incident: my mom gay
ITS 3 AM IM LAUGHING SO HARD BC THESE YT FF ARE LIKE: â€œwhen your bully finds out your boyfriend abuses you 21+â€ AND THE BG IS A POORLY PHOTOSHOPPED JUNGKOOK IN FRONT OF A GETTYIMAGES SCHOOL HALLWAY
girls who bullied me in high school are gfs now and im bin
I remember i started getting bullied in the second grade for having dark skin &amp; it didnâ€™t stop until I got to high school. This is part of the reason Iâ€™ve been working on creating my non profit, so that ALL black girls know that their skin is BEAUTIFUL
Seems innocuous enough but what good things can the Children sing about Trump? Pussy grabbing, raping, and being a bully isnâ€™t elementary school material
theyâ€™re high school bullies
and it doesnâ€™t make sense because all these â€œaltâ€ kids r the same people that would bully me for being emo in middle school lol
no one: girls who bullied me in high school: Hi Nicole, I'd like to join your LinkedIn network.
I LOVE seeing my old menâ€™s high school hockey teammates in relationships with the exact type of girl they bullied me for looking like. Thanks for the memories, boys!!!
Itâ€™s bc they were all bullies in school and now they have no one to take it out on bc they still hate themselves:((
girls who bullied you in high school for only wearing black and having breakdowns be calling them selves emo alt queens now
Yup Phys Ed and school sports is way overblown and over funded. If city kids could bike to school you would have healthier kids. School sports seems to be for kids who play on teams outsie school. Hockey and football guys were biggest bullies.
Nigga u graduated high school now stay away from these freshmens
Thinking about the girl at my high school who lied to our dean saying that I bullied her and since she was white the dean didnâ€™t even ask for my side of the story
Itâ€™s so ironic and funny seeing the girls who bullied me in high school working mediocre jobs around here.
I was bullied in jr high. I was embarrassed that my mom called a meeting with the principal and the girls who bullied me. The aftermath, neither of them talked to me again, and I lost all my other friends. I didnâ€™t have a friend until junior year of high school. I survived.
Angry! Under extreme marginalization and heavy family burden, nearly dead by nelsoncat production. While school assists HIM to hide the truth and harm me till March 2020. Till now, coordinating gang of public bully me. Bad intention will forecast the evil purpose of fake HKP
When I see poorly shot wedding photos I feel bad for the bride. Unless the bride is the girl that bullied you in high school. Very satisfied. 10/10 would like to see more of that.
You can tell who peaked in high school on here. Itâ€™s those ones that bully everyone and think they can have an opinion on appearances when they arenâ€™t much to look at either.
in fifth grade: for liking high school musical in eighth grade: for liking twilight those same girls that bullied me for both, now watch both during marathons
Lhdab @ this child here...do ya homework jerk, u new 2d play ground, I'm a school yard bully u new kid
Trump and the know nothing GOP made it so. They refuse to listen to the health experts, and then bully them into saying what Trump wants to hear. That's how the CDC modified their guidance. It wasn't based on anything other than Trump's desire to reopen schools risking everyone
No offense to band kids who might follow me but some band kids are the actual worst people I met in high school. One tried to out me infront of a large group of students and a group of band kids bullied a girl because she broke up with one of them to focus on studying...
>:( That's not a peer, that's a bully. I failed exams in my first year too. It happens more often than anyone will admit, but it's reality. Medical school is exhausting.
Yeah, honey, that's my point. I didn't get to play on organized teams leading up to high school like most kids. I got bullied and/or kicked off the girls teams bc I "played like a boy," and that wasn't fair somehow. And I couldn't join the boys teams(believe be I tried) bc vag.
Mom brutally attacked by teen girls outside CA high school; confrontation over bullied daughter https://abc7chicago.com/mom-brutally-attacked-by-teen-girls-outside-ca-high-school/5833801/
Fattest girl, wearing frumpy clothes because plus sizes were solely for old ladies in the late 80s and early 90s. Spent junior high being bullied for existing, so a hardcore loner hanging out as far away from everyone as possible. Played solitaire or read during lunch.
smh high school fucking bullies over here
He's relatable to teens. He's a kid in High school trying to get by. Gets bullied. Has a crush on a girl. Yeah sure Tony may have felt like his father figure. He wasnt in his early life until he became Spider-Man. Peter was still a kid who lived in a small apartment with aunt May
This girl I bullied in high school just sent me $20 I have to apologize now don't I :/
Lmaoo some girl on high school got bullied so bad that the administration had to call a meeting about it
I taught middle school. These kids have been through every bully prevention/be kind programout there since pre school. And now itâ€™s pro bully culture. I also taught during Just Say No and DARE. Lol. Loved teaching &amp; subbing.
STORY TIME : I took English Studies because I was bullied by my English teachers My English teacher in soph year in high school called me an audacious bitch in class. Ya girl owned it, and I said "yeah I'm a bitch"
finally a movie for tall girls cuz i was so bullied and undesirable to men and hahaha just fuckin around iâ€™m sexy and fun and can reach high shelves and see the stage at concerts
My secondary school seniors used to bully me to freestyle for them just cause they heard me rap once. The pressure made me say nonsense all the time Lowkey do not miss it
He reminded me of my High School Bullies.
I'm seeing some of my high school bullies soon at our 10 year reunion. Let's just hoped they matured because 27 year old me doesn't play being bullied. I'm grown there is a distinct difference between the girl I was and the woman I've become.
this broke my heart. first, that my little brother gets bullied. second, that girls in high school are rude not only to other girls but to guys also. third, that he had the maturity to not let her comment affect him and just kept walking like itâ€™s nothing new to him.
Then thatâ€™s your choice. Just donâ€™t bully others who want their kids to receive an education. For some kids, school is a sanctuary where they escape abuse &amp; are fed. My daughter is a PNP &amp; sees that as a bigger threat than getting COVID.
Obvious question of the day: How the hell can President Pandemic bully schools around the country to open - asserting that it's now safe to gather in groups - while at the same time cancelling the Republican convention in Jacksonville, saying itâ€™s not safe to gather?
I never liked the movie Mean Girls except for Tina Fey. Everything else about it was kind of gross, all about cliques and super popular kids whom were cruel to everybody to become the evil prom queen. Mostly since I was always bullied in high school.
The same girls on onlyfans are the same ones that bullied me in high school when my pictures leaked so yeah Iâ€™m a little angry
Huh? School hasnâ€™t been gone that long has it? #prayforourfuture
The Hom*phobic high school bullies
This girl from my high school bullied my friend for being a lesbian and then came out as lesbian in college lol
i just found out a girl i went to high school with who bullied me for liking doctor who uses cosplays now on onlyfans and one of the cosplays she does are characters from doctor who !!! are u kidding me ? no, i will not give you her info.
This is the high school bully who couldn't get another job so he went back to his old stomping ground...
the girl who literally bullied and harrassed me the ENTIRE time i attended carlson high school just came up on tinder iâ€™m scREAMING
Thinking outside the box here, what if we keep private schools due to their enormous value as posh kid bullying factories? But then we prohibit the surviving bullies from ever holding public office when they grow up, obviously.
Real word doesnâ€™t give shit about their high school popularity. They now have jobs where they can be that bully again and they are afraid of going back to their meaningless lives.
There were also girls who were bullied in high school who became nurses?
clearly most of the people in the quotes went to school where next to no one was a kpop fan and they didnâ€™t tell anyone they liked kpop either talking about how theyâ€™d bully everyone like I donâ€™t think youâ€™ve ever bullied anyone irl lmao
i had alopecia in high school so i was mostly bullied for being the bald girl who wore wigs. some classmates joked about ripping it off in class (some actually tried). i was also just pretty awkward looking back then
The bullies or the bullied? Because at my school this dude was the guy shoving people into lockers before getting dishonorably discharged for hiding meth in his commanding officer's refrigerator while deployed.
i feel like a lot of times its these people who were bullied in school and now are like crazed with power cus they have the ability to bully others
How long will it take 4 students 2 realize that threatening to/or removing a face mask can be used as... (1) a weapon in a student fight (2) a weapon to bully other students (3) a weapon to threaten personal harm 2 school staff @MOREcaucusUFT @BxEU4J @MindyRosier @AntiSoylent
How i feel when i shoot the bully in my school
Parents at private school and teachers didn't bully the gov to close schools shem. Public schools and people on twitter with no kids said the gov is sacrificing kids as sacrificial lambs and bullied the President till he closed the schools that he had control of.
Ryuji: *Saves the whole team from a near death situation by putting his life on the line* Morgana: *Gets petty over being left behind on a school trip and getting insulted by someone he bullies constantly (funnily enough being Ryuji again)*
stg if one more person bullies me when I go back to school I'll call my grandma down from heaven and she will STRANGLE THEM with her babushka. her bones may have been frail but she could pack a punch
Dude said he a chess master, so I ask him why and how? His reply had me in tears. He said â€œI got a girl pregnant in high school so I told my parents I was getting bullied and we moved lolâ€ Outstanding Move... #ENERGY #WC1412 #TheSlum
Dude who is sexiest tagged me in a live post that another girl wasn't happy about and him and his friends bullied her then when I said something one of his followers said I needed to be careful what I say. It was dumb and so high school
me: why are people attracted to dumbasshole cishet men. U know who I mean, Like Iâ€™ve only met like 3 of those guys that didnâ€™t have at least 1 really really bad take on a serious issue also me: hey cishet girls, I donâ€™t care if you bullied me in high school, snap me kaxamdays
She must have been that girl in high school that bullied everyone and thought it was funny
I remember behavior like this in elementary school. If everyone stands up to the school bully, then you take away his/her power. @Walmart you are a billion dollar company, surely you can hire guards.
Go Niner's! I'm really getting tired of this bullshit. Favre has always seemed like an asshole to me. Seems like he could have been a bully in school.
I was just subjected to a group text of girls on my high school softball team who bullied me RELENTLESSLY when I was going through a really rough time in my life
I must say. All this kak takes me back to High School. I havenâ€™t been told Iâ€™m an attention seeker since then. One time a girl told everyone Iâ€™m telling them Iâ€™m Gay for attention. Lmaoooo. I canâ€™t make this shit up. Yeah cos I chose to be bullied
theyâ€™re someone i would bully at school just because
Yeah but I think I used the old one I'll try again until I have something....I also remember reading a manga about a high school girl who has plotted to kill all her classmates that bullied her. That was my first gore manga
My external family was two-faced and wanted nothing to do with me because I wasn't normal. I was bullied in high school, and my supposed friends treated me like trash and made me ride in a trunk after partying to make room for "girl"
These girls make up stories about being bullied as a kid like you know we all went to the same high school right???? Lol
I ran into mine recently, and she was marveling at how her daughter is being bullied and said â€œI just donâ€™t remember mean girls in high school!â€ and I said â€œbecause YOU WERE THE MEAN GIRL.â€ She looked at me blankly.
This is more high school "mean girls" treatment of a kid who was obviously pretty bullied. Now those same folk are piling on again. No one said one word when it could have made a difference. Names aren't blacked out on original posts Gossip helps nothing
Someone who I donâ€™t think was trying to be hurtful once said the same about my daughter at her school. That person was overheard and within weeks a nasty little clique had christened my daughter Myra. It was a dreadful experience for her and only reinforced my dislike of bullies.
Oh, Luca. I'm so sorry this is happening to you. It's the bullies' weakness, not yours, though that's small compensation while you're going through it. Schools need to do more to deal with it. Strength to you, Luca. You'll survive it.
Saw a photo from an old bully from high school; she's now a prison guard at a corrections centre lmao checks out
He was bullied by girls all his high school years. That must had been hurtful
Pay for my knee surgery. Iâ€™ll damn near have the school playin in the SEC in 2 years
they are the school yard bullies who enjoyed being a bully, that found a job where they got to stay the bully.
@2015seniorprobs: I probably wouldn&#8217;t mind school as much if we didn&#8217;t have to deal with bitch ass teachers. Retweet
Thank you I thought it was ridiculous being bullied by people who still act like high school girls, at the same time, I was losing my confidence by dealing with them at the workplace!
girls who bullied me to the brink of suicide in high school becoming nurses like
the girl who bullied me about liking blackbear pops up on my fyp high on drugs making no sense. yeah IM WEIRD
We all want Joe Biden. No bully name needed to win. You are failing ALL Americans. Or at least the half that donâ€™t fall in line with everything you say. Pull school funding because governors donâ€™t want kids to die. Your Republican states are dieing from #COVID19
I think I could handle the cruelty of school kids way better now knowing more about the psychology of why they bully, and having dealt with far worse people as an adult. Waiting tables was way worse than high school.
i love seeing the girls who bullied me in high school posting selfies on instagram in honor of â€œsupporting other womenâ€ LMAO kick rocks Alexandra
this girl from high school preaching about black lives matter when she bullied me so hard for being gay lmao yâ€™all canâ€™t support one but not the other shut tf up
Exactly. making fun of Christians is like being the school bully and picking on the new kids. You know they wont do sh*t abotu it.
abby dahlk*mper looks exactly like all of the girls i went to high school with that played soccer and bullied everyone and it really triggers me LMAO
Sure, school kids basically bully anyone different, if I didn't reply to your first two LinkedIn messages, I'm interested.
the 'radical' cis folks love saying 'arm the trans kids' right til one of us marches into a school and sends their bully to hell
Can everyone still at school, not bully their teachers, like I genuinely mean it
I donâ€™t even know why I was bullied. I donâ€™t think bullies need a reason. I didnâ€™t fit in with the popular crowd so that was enough for them, I guess. I got a pixie cut in high school and heard ppl whispering â€œdykeâ€ in the halls because apparently short hair = attracted to girls
THEN RESIGN SO IT WILL TRAITOR. I still want to know about the #RussianBounty you ignored. Or why a vote TRUMPs life since the #TrumpVirus has cost so many of them. SAD that Mr. #TrumpleThinSkin only wants to whine and cry like the school bully when we speak out. #ResignTrump
I'm not normally a fighter nor do I condone it but yes show that Bully! Coming from a girl who was bullied through middle and high school! Glad to see someone shut the bully down!
â€œ Black girls didnâ€™t like me because I got bullied in High School because I was a nice black guy in a anime shirtâ€
Guys I just saw someone tell a 13 year old girl that sheâ€™s gonna have no friends in high school and will be bullied for being a trump supporter racist and homophobic and will grow up to be a drop out and work at a gas station... AND ID DO IT AGAIN BOP BOP
I can't believe what I just saw. I've been with Mingyu ever since we were in middle school and this kid can't even lift a single finger to defend himself from bullies but now, no words can depict how traumatizing what I've seen.
All the girls I bullied in high school have kids. #yourewelcome
@Paytonhodges Bitch i missed you to , when yo ugly ass commin back to school ? (:
tinder experience is just matching with all the alt girls i had 1 class with in high school who probably bullied me at some point
They're all just participating in the lie as a power play. They get off on it emotionally. I view it like the bully in school who knocks books out of a kid's hands then denies it and then his three friends, who helped corner the victim, chime in saying he didn't do it.
S/o Ben Shapiroâ€™s middle school bullies
the girls who bullied you in high school are now training to become PSWs to commit elder abuse
I am glad Trek was there for you during the miserable time at high school. It has been there for me too at tough times. High school is very tough everyone is so judgmental about how you look, talk etc... If you like to study you can be a prime target for bullies
girl who bullied you in jr high: omg hey girl hey!! itâ€™s been SO LONG! how are you doing babe?? i just got this super exciting opportunity and and as a fellow boss babe i TOTALLY thought of you as someone who would LOVE it!!!
She's the archetypal school bully.
#WhyIDontLikeTrump He's basically everything I hate rolled into one package: school bully, rich asshole w/o consequence, abuser, liar, anti-science, totalitarian, one of the few people in my life who has made me say "maybe loving all humanity and life is overrated."
when i was at high school in 2005 all the queer kids got outed and bullied while the straight girls had binders full of livejournal printouts of this stuff, the early to mid 00s were bleak

when someone mentions me & my middle school bully says â€˜ omg stephanie !? yeah i know her sheâ€™s sooo pretty ! â€˜ babe youâ€™re the reason i have body dysmorphia thx tho :^

the most pointless character...and yet i canâ€™t stand jandi for falling for the guy who literally caused the whole school to bully her i remember the actorâ€™s name more heâ€™s fine as fuck canâ€™t believe he was a side character not even a second lead

I think IT bloggers should blog like recipe bloggers with some childhood story and how it relates to running IT systems. "This guy used to bully me in grade school, so I made all his password expire every week, here's how..."
He was a bully in high school (Horace Mann in NYC). Nothingâ€™s changed.
you had every right to tell her... everyone cares when itâ€™s the skinny white girl getting â€œbulliedâ€ but when it was the bigger guy in high school it was okay
No but there was a time a bully in elementary school would keep asking for half of my burger if i ever had one. I was scared of being targeted so id comply. To stop this, I ate the burger in a circle to make sure every eend had my bite marks.
This girl in high school bullied the fuck out of a bi girl who was dating a girl for being a lesbian... like would not shut the fuck up about it... She has a girlfriend now? you gonna apologize to all the â€œdykesâ€

Yâ€™all ever look at the bitches who used to bully you in high school and they end with the ugliest looking piece of scum man and youâ€™re out here dating the hottest women to walk the earth bc sameeeeeeee
Get this my school bully actually joined the Church and did preaching from the bible at the Alter #Oy no down on her knees &amp; asking forgiveness... I guess Iâ€™m assuming everyone has seen movie The 10 Commandments
Bullies. The problem is we let them get their way in schools. So they never stopped. Because they never learned. Because they were never taught. No offense, teachers, this isn't a lesson you can teach most of them.
Awake thinking about the bitch in my Qual. Methods course who has somehow managed to bully me?? In class breakout sessions? Virtually?? In grad school??? Like, okay Regina George. Fuck.
I feel like thereâ€™s a trend around royale high and itâ€™s where people are constantly putting these things on their names: cute, shy, tomboy, bad girl, gets bullied, weird, no one likes, scary, SINGLE(violates terms of service), and many other. These are usually attention seekers.
Right! The thought is so crazy that if it ever happened, the cop would be awarded the freakin' Nobel Peace Prize! Just reminds me of back in school how many kids actually cheered on the bully on the playground. These types are no different
Bill I love veryone :) I get bully a lot back at school but now itâ€™s closed :) and I happy now I feel such a good person now and helpful!! Bles everyone!!!
Iâ€™m not prepared for Luna to grow up and go to school because if one of yallâ€™s snotty nosed kids bully my child Iâ€™m beating a childâ€™s ass. on sight
@curryspcworld the advert your currently running on radio where the girl is ashamed of her laptop when she see's another student, is it not bad taste? encouraging people to go into debt so they don't get bullied, financial pressure on parents this time of year is already high
This makes me want to bully Kennedy more. But look at him. You know if he wasnt a Kennedy would have been bullied like crazy in school.
You pay and obsess over hot girls online because you were bullied and used for amusement and homework all throughout high school
People in Fulton County who were bullies in high school who are now having this good vibes spiritual awakening.. No thank you
every time a girl that bullied me in high school tries to get me to join their pyramid scheme i level up
Before I tested in Bronx Science, one of NYC's gifted schools, I had a few good friends but also quite a number of bullies who called me a coon, an Uncle Tom, got into scrapes with them Had I stayed in the local school system... probably would still be working in McD's
Yes Iâ€™m 25 years old & sent this to a teenager who thinks itâ€™s cute to be a bully. Also, I was bullied constantly in high school for being dark skin &amp; had to deal with nutty girls like this. Ugh. The ugliest. https://twitter.com/wavyemma/status/1262772443963244549
I went through a lot of this, growing up, so I can understand the feeling. Even from people who knew me in school and college, but who couldn't at least voice their issues in person. Instead, such people chose to hide behind a screen and bully me online.
I watch things where kids get bullied off the dumbest shit &amp; get soo mad like girl fuck that kid &amp; his opinion lmao. I pray I build my future kids confidence &amp; self esteem up so high they just look at ppl who say stupid shit &amp; laugh.
Was thinking about this today. He's like the high school bully who has to surround himself with goons who will protect or fight FOR him. If he ever got challenged, he'd back down like the coward he is.
i also got bullied when I was 4-6 but that was jst because i was a tomboy and five yr old girls are mean. i got a rock thrown at me and at my house several times (once got hit directly in the eye) and was made to eat dirt another time lmao. jokes on them they peaked in high skl
LMAOO donâ€™t throw shade in the first sentence & end with â€œletâ€™s each otherâ€ like, high school bully much???
do not buy watered down snake oil cbd gummies from that girl who bullied u in high school know ur worth queen
We've all been through school K-12. We've all seen bullies and sports jocks and of course one idiot that brags and acts like tRump. Inevitably that braggart ends up with his face rearranged by one of the bullies. I'm curious why someone hasn't punched mango Mussolini?
The freakin' school bully is in a govt. Seat....amazing...never grew out of his bullying ways..needs to lose his seat.
Then after I recovered I went to this school and it was alright so I made a new friend her name was hayley spelled the same way me and her were in band and pe she was so nice then one day I seen the my bully when to the same school as me her mom pulled me aside and said you bitch
Iâ€™m LOLing at this girl who bullied me in high school becoming a self-proclaimed â€œlife coach.â€
all the power he wants/needs. *IMPEACH BARR NOW* He is the puppeteer and Trump is his puppet. Barr is a bully and has been since grammar school. A bully in any position of power looks like this. *IMPEACH BARR NOW* @ProjectLincoln @glennkirschner2 @gtconway3d @donwinslow
no more drugs at school no more bullies at school no more school shootings at school no more teenage pregnancies which means no more unwed on welfare no more abortions no more dead beat fathers no more kids growing up without fathers to shoot up stores get the point? You take the
he looks like the girls in high school who bullied me for not wearing makeup lol
The girls who bullied you in Junior High School grew up and got a tv talk show.
As Trump bullies CDC to reopen on schools we should consult Mary Trumps book for clues. Why does he hate children? Could it be because they arenâ€™t strong? Like so many who have been killed thus far by COVID-19?
Similar thing happened with Mike. Got tripped up by a bully, broke his collar bone &amp; the teacher told him to carry on. Safe to say my headteacher of a mum was not happy. But now he likes to run, cycle and hike. Guess itâ€™s important to not let your school exp define you for life.
nahh cause elementary school bullies be real creative. went to school one day with braids and was forever called black madusa
I was not aware that there are people who still act like middle school bullies over the age of 17
damn I sometimes think about those girls who bullied me in high school because I called them out for bullying another girl so badly she transferred, but moreso I think about that girl and how sheâ€™s literally living in Hawaii now, having the time of her life
Will never forget when a girl who yelled that she was going to kill me in the middle of a school debate between us messaged me years later to say that she's had to go to therapy because she felt bullied and oppressed by me throughout high school... i mean???
I'm a 51 year old too. Was picked on and bullied from the age of 5 by the same group of girls til I left high school at 16. Can pretty much remember every name they called me.
NOT MY SISTERS TELLING ME THEY BULLIED THESE GIRLS ON ROBLOX ROYAL HIGH FOR BEING TRUMP SUPPORTERS GOD HELP ME
A group of girls when i was a freshman in high school said i was acting like them or â€œcopyingâ€ them, im still confused by that cause im deadass an awkward weirdo, i got bullied for being overweight, having too much moles on my face, big eyes, my name â€œleiza lizardâ€
girls who bullied me in high school are my dicks now and im pants
I get bullied because of my size ever in high school I have been called fat, a girl took my lunch money and I was scared to open up to my mother because I didnâ€™t know what to do but I am me, we are all unique in our own special way whatever the skin colour, size, or sexuality
Ive been reflecting on my experience as a black feminist in high school. And how I have been vocal about blm online since I was 16 &amp; I got a lot of shit for it. I was bullied &amp; harassed by my classmates. Unsurprisingly it was pretty much only black girls who defended and stood up
That's the problem nowadays mate, in this generation it seems at least in high schools in Canada girls get bullied by other girls if they don't have a boyfriend, seems to be the same for guys too. The media and magazines are to blame.
Schools, universities and landlords asking to be paid in cash dollars. These are some of the the bullies that need to be stopped by swift and firm legislation
...He tolerates the bullying and tries as much as possible to appease them when the opportunity arises. One afternoon, West on his way from school witnessed the bullies beating up another boy. He was forced fed grass and dust. This is West's opportunity. To ally with the bully.
THISSS LMAO the girls who bullied me in middle/high school tryna sell me hair products now
plss my ex oomfs are bullies school fucking bullies
@bella_jella97 I'm in middle school, and yes I'm a bully victim too sorry! I know it's horrible!
As a child I was bullied, I was excluded, I was even beat up for being â€œfatâ€ In high school... I was overly sexualized and convinced I would be pretty if I just lost weight. And the common thing to say was Lacey is hot for a fat girl â€œIâ€™d fuck her but not date her.â€
All the girls that bullied me in high school are now trying to recruit me for their pyramid schemes
i am in a similar situation tbh my mom doesn't really care , my father is homophobic and my school is too . my classmates describe gay ppl as "disgusting" and they even said that once they see a gay person they would bully the shit out of them , so yeah pray for my bi ass
kwkwkw punya pengalaman yak ka ? Iâ€™ve been bullied verbally since high school some even said to me that I should move to Bali to find foreign husband because foreigners like girl like me who has exotic skin tone dengan kata lain bule kan sukanya ama yang item2 kaya lo kwkw fak
â€” bully at her old school, yet here she was, despite being pissed at being knocked over, feeling something totally new to her. She glared at the giggling girls, before she took off out the door after the girl.
It was so annoying like I came out in middle school leave me alone
At my high school popular girls didnâ€™t but if you werenâ€™t a cheerleader or an athlete then you got bullied. Literally by girls who liked the same things you did
Sheâ€™s always acted like the victim, sheâ€™s bullied so many people in grade/high school and never got in trouble. She always acts like sheâ€™s hot shit when in reality shes the weird horse girl that no one likes
the girls that bullied me in high school are all invested in shitty MLMs, so who is the real winner here?
Private school teachers are THE most screwed professionals in America. Qualifications: multiple degrees, current licensure, passionate teacher. Benefits: poverty wages &amp; parents that bully you. Perks: expected to do sales job promoting the school or your school will go broke.
-I was bullied in the 7th grade by every girl in the 7th &amp; 8th-grade classes. -I was outcasted in high school (not sure why but I've been told it was because females didn't like me for various reasons). -Lost multiple best friends (females) oftentimes for unclear reasons but
I had a dream where I beat up my elementary school bully and beat him in basketball. Today is gonna be a good day.
Super! And you can tell she was bullied in high school bc shes a mean girl now. Davina is literally a shit stirrer! I hate how in season 2 heather and christine are bffs now, so fake!
She is a queen-bee, mean-girl thug of the kind found in high schools everywhere. The kind we lie to bullied kids about and tell them they â€œgrow out of it.â€ They donâ€™t.
Was bullied in high school for bad English because I just came from a village school in grade 9. Till today, 15 years later I still hate that girl Penny.... et al even
RULES TO TEACH YOUR KIDS: Never shake a hand sitting down. Donâ€™t take the first offer. Hold your heroes to high standards. Ask out the best looking guy/girl in the room. Eat lunch with the new kid. Manners matter. Protect those bullied. Be confident &amp; humble. #coachestribune
A girl that bullied me in high school about my brother being in jail just got charged with selling METH and FENTANYL! Karmaâ€™s a motherfucking bitch.

They are just against stupidity from a grade school bully president
girl who bullied you in high school asking you to join her pyramid scheme ASMR
god I wish I had friends so we could gang up on my bully and soulfully perform replay and then transition into an aggressive sherlock and put my bully to shame like we're in high school musical or something
i never really publicized it because i was already isolated by a girl in high school so i didnâ€™t want to make it worse. but, i wasnâ€™t scared to be bullied because of liking k-pop, i was more scared of the fact that people would be close-minded because â€œi donâ€™t know how you can +
Bro how we got the same story? These two girls that bullied me in high school both got pregnant later that same year
Life is full of bitchy people who want to eliminate people so that they can climb the food chain. Thereâ€™s a girl named Ronda from high school who bullied me before I grew to be 5â€™10â€ it kinda makes me wants to attend a reunion.
Midoriya began his torrent of nonstop muttering, listing the pros and cons of Katsuki and Ochakoâ€™s fighting styles. As he began to list a series of childhood scuffles Katsuki got into with school bullies as â€˜bonus material to take into considerationâ€™, the match had already begun.
i feel like a hot queer version of every girl that bullied me in high school and iâ€™m living for it
the amount of time I just spent fb stalking the girls who bullied me in high school...concerning
Idk anything about Idina Menzel except that she gives off the exact vibe of every show choir girl that bullied me in high school
It's a show of Dem self humiliation. They act like high school bully, no class, no civility. The show of rudeness and arrogance has the same mentality of mob protesters.
and iâ€™m not going to sit down and make a video with screenshots exposing my bUlLiEs these are bUlLiEs these are high school fucking BULLIES
This video really brought back Middle School/ High School trauma for me. I was bullied relentlessly and it always seemed to be over a nigga and the entire school would be involved. I hope that little girl is okay emotionally and physically. Experiences like this can harden you
I was bullied and outcast into eating disorders and depression throughout middle/high school. But today: as a low income girl, raised by a single mother (who recently passed away 1 year ago), in a 1 bedroom apt, I am steps away from graduating harvard on full FA with honors
Yes, join me in my tears as I think about SHINee sending Taemin to school to protect him from bullies He was really so young omg
high schoolers are ruthless. girls get bullied for being over 6 feet tall. so why are yâ€™all mad that they made a movie about it
The fuck, shooting a school bully isn't self defense lmao.
No parents won't get into trouble because home schooling is perfectly legal.. Schools like to bully parents to get government funding.. Governments like to bully parents to keep them in systems that teach them what to think and not how to think.
I bet she bullied girls in high school.
pretty sure most terfs got bullied in high school by the pretty girls
the way my sisters were the popular high school bullies mmmm...
It was horrible primary school was okay lol.. Junior high and Senior were the pits. There was another girl from Tanzania who was also being bullied so we became best friends till this day
Suicide rates have skyrocketed since social media became prominent, 14% of high school kids have contemplated suicide, bullied kids are up to 9 times more likely to commit suicide, and girls are more likely than boys. It's not something you can deduce that far with much validity.
My friend Olivia and I have been friends since 2011. She's the only person from my primary school I'm still really close to
The memories today were sad, especially as it reminded me of what kind of person A was. He was a jokester. He sort of glued our class together into being the nicest class in school. He was also instrumental in helping turn someone who was bullying me into...not a bully.
Exclus have the same energy as those people in school who are like â€œomg!! iâ€™m SO inclusive i LOVE neurodivergent people!! i just think that any neurodivergent behaviour is fucking gross and weird and i will bully you for showing it.â€
I grew up in the 50s-60s. We had telephones, playgroups, clubs, school cliques and bullies. All were very effective transmitters of farragos of fact, fiction, envy, spite, admiration, insult, status, scandal. Not quite 24/7 but pretty close.
No, because she is a huge phony. Was bullied in high school and called the N word by some white girls. Had the NAACP sue for her for a HUGE sum of money. She HATES when blacks are victims unless it is her.
It blows me when parents be worst than the bullies at school
I was thinking the same thing too, but then my mom was like â€œ the staffâ€.... the school bus drivers, most do them are older, the janitors, the lunch ladies, substitute teachers. I just want my baby to be in an environment thatâ€™s best for him. I wish he can go back to school.
Found out that the girl who bullied me all throughout high school is going to grad school for psychology / counseling...... ....... .......
Hijabi lives in a diverse community and joins the fencing team after impressing everyone in school, goes pro and beats her childhood white bully at his own game and gets her revenge.

Never. Iâ€™ve never loathed anyone more. Not even the girl who bullied me in high school
If famous people with double-barrelled surnames had them sawn-off at the end like shotguns, would they sound like bullies from a 1980's comprehensive school? Tony Worrall Lozza Llewellyn Andy &amp; Jules Lloyd Billy Rees Danny Day John Cooper john Cougar Ralph Vaughan Pheebs Waller
they gonna bully this nigga at school and call him names like winfrey
@howleriq you look like every bully, who is acting out because his parents are getting divorced, in every movie about middle school kids.
this girl literally bullied the shit out of me and was just a snobby ass brat. ruined my high school years and i told my CHILDHOOD friend about her and what she did and she still hangs out and supports her... wtf? iâ€™m so disappointed.
my high school was pretty ghetto so ppl would have fights outside of the school all the time, one time a pregnant girl pulled up and fought a bitch and surprisingly won, and she was like 7 months, but I donâ€™t think any got physically bullied
He looks a lot like my OC 'Boyfriend' in high school that I named Henry. @WarWizardz convinced me to do this, because he is both a bully and hype-man.
This paedo conso saw me today and asked why I had so much beards. From the way she was looking at me, I'm sure she wished school was on session so she could bully me to shave it. Obeya 1 : 0 Conso. .
All the people I used to bully in middle school â€œhey girl! Hope youâ€™re doing well! Pls watch this short video and give me money â€
One junior student I do bully in secondary school just finished from a military school,he posted a picture with a Gun and tagged only me. #BBNaija #bbnaija2020 Should I be worried??
fun fact about the last picture: the kid on the left is a cop now and the girl on the right hated me for no apparent reason and bullied me/made my life fucking miserable until high school graduation
Same, but for me itâ€™s high school bullies, not crushes, which makes it all the more sweeter.
Luca, be strong here .... at the end of the day bullies are just "cowards"!! We have all in one way or another experienced "school bullies" and it hurts deeply! Stand up to them and see how they react and how many will follow you rather than them! Much love to you Luca
it also stemmed from the girls who bullied me when i was younger. i realized later it was wrong to assume the worst of girls because of my history with them. in high school i met other girls who treated me right and they were amazing friends to me.
I had friends at my old school they used me and then i got new friends they left i got new friends they used me a bully turned all my friends agianst me i made one true friend but then moved the next year at my new school i made friends they found me to annoying so they left-
There are 2 groups within Trump's Cult: _ School yard Bullies who admire &amp; cheer for the Bully in the WH. _ Those who are too intimidated &amp; fear Trump, and remain silent while doing his bidding as part of his quid pro quo deal-making. In other words, Republicans.
...she looks like she wouldâ€™ve bullied me in high school in 2007, and not in a homoerotic way. she looks like all the Kohlâ€™s-shopping wannabe popular girls in 2007.
I would also like to add that a lot of girls hate Nicki because of sheâ€™s both beautiful and cocky. One YouTuber who slandered Nicki said that she hated Nicki because she reminded her of the pretty girls who bullied her in high school but she realized Nicki is not those girls
A cop from where I grew up in nh used to harass high school girls and make them suck his dick to be let go... He got killed by one of the kids he bullied. #makecopsillegal
i was bullied in high school and iâ€™m going into nursing school i wasnâ€™t a mean girl except for this one friend who would fight w me all the time
It's actually directly related to the tiktok girl. This "type" of girl is the kind she wished she "bullied better" in high school. Meaning she wants to bully all girls such as the one in the tiktok for just having an opinion.
I just happened to find out that the girl who bullied me all throughout grade school (some high school too) and was obsessed with copying me, also went into graphic design. This girl was never artistically inclined. How creepy is it, that she is still low-key stalking me!?
This girl who bullied the hell out of me in high school is apparently now supporting my makeup journey? But like a ghost... Never likes or comments but watches my stories...??? I'm... Confused??
Love my soft high school bully looking son and his little buddy with an even littler ponytail.
Ah yes some random thing on Reddit making me remember how people at school decided to bully me because I was lactose intolerant and had to bring my own food.
Most of the girls that bullied me in high school are all still really hot and wealthy and didnâ€™t get ugly like 15 yo me had hoped!
Brands with 400 followers run by girls who bullied you in high school trying to get me to collaborate...... is not it.......
MegaTokyo lives in an ancient, untouched, and cursed part of my brain. Stoked to find out theyâ€™re still going today, in the same way youâ€™re stoked to find out your middle school bully got his teckdeck taken by your English teacher msThompson
Avoiding zero-gravity swirlies has been a full-time job for 12-yo Connor ever since he arrived at his new school. So when he discovers a strange telepathic connection that allows him to hack devices with his mind, he sees an opportunity to get even with his bullies. #SFFpit #MG
thoughts on yumeko. this is not her. SCHOOL BULLIES
Me in high school: gets bullied for having black hair and other reasons that make zero sense. Girls who bullied me: have dyed their hair black and complain on Facebook about how mean kids are bullying their kids.
My favorite part of the decade was getting violently cyber bullied on Tumblr in high school and a teacher took the other girlâ€™s side and blamed me.
No vote's meaningless. It's a right to vote to represent one's conscience. We must change to ranked-choice voting, though, so every vote counts to determine a winner. The present system gives all the power to only the two bigger bullies in the school yard. #RankedChoiceVoting
I got bullied for: being a victim of pedophilia being alone being chubby being 11 and not shaving my mustache having the weirdest and loudest girl in the school as my best friend my dad not being present I hated high school, but it gave the most wonderful people!

This kid called Will who used to bully me and Dan in primary school asked his uncle if he could work with him, his uncle works with my dad/Dan. Didn't know this was his uncle till he said who his daughter was. Quite the revelation. But the uncle asked Dan to teach Will.

The US is the high school bully nobody likes.
She loves it. Five bucks says she also bullied other girls in middle and high school
so i was feeling pretty self conscious and crappy earlier for some reason, and then stumbled across the facebook page of the girl who bullied me ALL through high school.
I bet she was an arrogant bully at school..
this made me so mad like this is something my secondary school bully would say
I was bullied in high school because of a medical condition. Worse yet, it was an all girls Catholic H.S. I sign petitions whenever I can about getting bullies out of schools. Life is too short for school kids of any age to be picked on!!
I've bought one of those anti-bullying wristbands. Well, when I say 'bought', I snatched it off some short fat ginger kid...
Some guy out there is like: One time this girl I bullied in high school matched me on Tinder and we fucked and then the next day she said she was breaking up with me cuz I bullied her in high school and I remembered why everyone made fun of her in high school.

Keep your self esteem high girl you're far superior than those shits who bullied you. Just ignore them they are even not worthy to be replied.
One time in grade school a girl I was friends with told my crush some things about me that werenâ€™t true and she hated me, so I ruined her life and got the whole school to hate her and bully her, it was rough. I donâ€™t know what happened but she stopped showing up after that
Girls who hate her for no reason are the same girls that bullied other girls based on their looks in high school. Insecure of themselves
these girls bullied me in high school just because I was from Clovis
ARU SHAH + GOONIES To locate a magical cure that will save his dying father, 13-yr-old Sam goes to the land of Decapolis with his 2 bfâ€™s. Theyâ€™re hailed as heroes, returned from the past - which has its benefits. But then a 4th "heroâ€ shows up - the school bully. #SFFpit #MG #FA
This guy mocks and trashes everyone. He then gets a sad face when everyone else does it to him in return? That's like the senior bully in school picking on the freshman. Then the freshmans older brother returning the favor.
I was bullied for being fat and clever, my tormentors were four black girls, one of them in high school became a famous athlete and a TV game show star. I am still fat and I don't hate black people.
Start networking. They tried their shit where I live and it lasted 1.5 days. They are the school bully looking for the wimpiest cities that won't fight.
okey i finished glee (dont judge im bored) and the whole storyline of blaine dating kurts old bully that gave him deaththreats and made his life a living hell so bad he had to change schools doesnâ€™t sit right w me

whatâ€™s so funny is that i literally got bullied out of my first high school for liking one direction. I ended up transferring. The same girls that made fun of me for liking them are blowing up their socials about the tenth anniversary like please kindly fuck off
I remember the first fight i had, it was senior year of high school, and was tired of getting bullied, i slammed that poor girls head againts a window three different times later that day i saw a post made by her saying â€œi thought I was going unconsciousâ€
no cuz i know this man has bullied a girl into starving herself at least once or twice in high school. i can feel it.
The 10-year challenge, along with creeping the Facebook photos of people I went to high school with, shows me that the people who were bullied get hot, the bullies and "cool" people let themselves go, and the average girls like myself kind of just stay the same.
Btw if you want to have more of a masc look, cut your fringe and tie your hair back and wear a hoodie with the hoâ€¦ â€” thank you! i had a fringe before but my school would bully me again so
I made another video of The varina high school staff I really do appreciate when u help me get through life and how to ignore bullies or haters @amseelyeducator @VHS_BlueDevils @CalderVHS
I'm a 60 yr old Nana. My last physical altercation was when I was 9, & an 11 yr old bully kept pushing my 7 yr old bro at the school bus stop. 51 years later, I wouldn't be against landing a throat punch on a certain screaming monkey. His neighbors must be saints.

These ladies really do remind me of the high school chicks...with all the bullying by one "Diva" and everyone stirring her on...
A friend who was a public school teacher for over 40 years told me that every year they would ask the kids what they wanted to be when they grew up, and when they mentioned being a cop, every year for over 40 years, the class bullies were the only ones to raise their hands
Starting some school shopping for my daughter on pro wrestling tees. And this is one of her first requests. Shes 8 and going into 3rd grade. Cant bully my kid. @abadon_AEW

//Can't reply at the moment so here is a video of my chickens. Their babies grew a lot since last time.
Iâ€™m so sick of the word bullied. Are we fucking 14? In high school? Jesus Christ people. We are all big boys n girls.
We are doomed Iâ€™m stuck in a nightmare that all the popular bullies from middle school are in charge
One time junior year of high school my ex made a sex tape with a girl who had bullied me since 6th grade while he and i were dating
#lrt that's so true lol, one of the girls that bullied me in high school is a midwife now
Got bullied in middle and early high school because I was always accepted by the girls and spent all my time with them but I didn't enjoy "guy talk" with the guys my age. Funny how that turned out.
A girl in the Mankhurd region of Mumbai was bullied by Muslim residents for raising her voice against the blaring of azaan in high volume from a neighborhood mosque in her area. https://www.opindia.com/2020/06/mumbai-girl-bullied-for-requesting-to-lower-volume-of-azaan-blaring-from-mosques-loudspeaker-local-mla-asks-her-to-leave-her-house/amp/

I love subs who dated girls through high school and secretly got turned on by the thought of getting bullied by the weird, hot boy in their class. The amount of men who feel a weight lift off their shoulders when they call me Daddy is just...astounding to me.
Iâ€™m in school for teaching and if I see a dork like this Iâ€™m telling my kids itâ€™s their legal obligation to bully him.
Michelle Obama graduated Harvard law school. Here are a few of her accomplishments. Melania is a porn star, who pays lip service to anti bullying, whilst her husband continues to be a bully. Nice try though.
not all the mean girls from my high school wanting to become elementary education majors like â€œi want to make a difference in a childâ€™s lifeâ€ you sure as hell made a difference in my life when you bullied the shit out of me in 8th grade
Yooo what happened to my tweet? Well anyway I followed some girl from high school and she blocked me cause shes a conservative and all I have to say is THANK YOU for doing the work for me. I would have definitely cyber bullied your ass after the first Trump retweet
I also find it interesting that the ones who said that they were bullied in high school or are the ones now who are doing the bullying or are the â€œmeanâ€ girls
remember when that welsh girl said that she would have bullied me if we had gone to the same high school like it was some huge dunk and then she tried to convince people that i was lying about my sister dying even tho other people on twitter had been to the funeral
She literally made me repeat the story for the secretary, the vice principal, and a parent doing a tour of the school. She was literally showing me off because I was eloquent. She never even punished the bully.
and then the entire school bullies you for being an f word yupp
girls have â€œdonâ€™t compare your life to someone elseâ€™s highlight reelâ€ in their Instagram bio then say that Sydney wasnâ€™t bullied in high school because thereâ€™s a pageant picture of her in the yearbook
It's really bad you let the school yard bully DT kick you in the ass, and call you names yet you still grovel behind him. If you have children, don't try to teach them integrity, they'll just wonder how they got such a coward.
Why donâ€™t you stop being a child calling people names!!! We punish bullies and namecalling in our schools. Why donâ€™t you EVER set an example for ANYONE????
The girl that used to bully me in high school told me happy birthday, does that mean Iâ€™m winning at life
gibby and sam. jade will talk shit but she canâ€™t back it up, while sam is completely about that action. plus, sam beat up carlyâ€™s school bully with ease. gibby practically destroyed nora twice so heâ€™s a solid pick.
The girls that stan Lizzo the hardest rn are the ones that bullied the weird/fat kids in high school.
I love that @Jo_dirty_dan knows when I need to have a night of eating stew, watching a crazy stressful horror movie, flashing back to the girls that bullied us in high school, and picking a slug off her wall (?!?!!) But no actually it was exactly what my brain needed tonight
Thank you. It luckily stopped when I suddenly got â€œcoolâ€ in high school. The sociological clicks kids endure are mind boggling. All the time, growing up, I stood up for other kids being bullied. But I could not shake the girl who seemed to be able frighten and manipulate me.
I know this is mean, but the majority of the girls in high school that bullied me for being â€œfatâ€ are HELLA over weight now
Fuck you and your mom..
A lot of hit tweets about how bg stans are "ugly fat white girls who were bullied in high school" and other lowkey sexist tweets are literally written by allo cis gay male gg stans
am I the only one who does not find this man attractive at all he looks like he will bully me in high school and roofie me in college
Cops are just kids who were either bullied in school or bullies with small dicks and now they hate the world
An old high school mate made fun of me for not calling this guy who bullied one of our girls a â€œpussyâ€ because she thought me saying â€œheâ€™s not worth itâ€ wasnâ€™t enough. I could call a man a â€œpussyâ€. But that would be a compliment.
idk about yâ€™all but he looks like bully me in middle school
My step-brother was dyslexic and bullied. I soon (as his only big sister) learned to stand up to the bullies who teased him, it was so bad he didnâ€™t want to go to school. I think itâ€™s why I still will fight quite strongly to this day for anyone being bullied or treated unfairly.
Personality At first, Danny was an average teenager attending high school, awkward and nervous but friendly. Like most teenagers, he had crushes on girls, desires to be popular, a dislike of bullies, and embarrassment about his parents. But unlike most teenagers he had ghostly
itâ€™s so funny seeing the girl that bullied me and made my high school experience a living hell post all these positive, uplifting, and inspiring things about â€œbeing kind to everyone, always.â€ coughcoughhypocritecoughcough.
when I get bullied in high school by this girl in my class my parents were like "don't worry you'll be more successful than her" WELL NOW SHE HAS 155k FOLLOWERS ON TIKTOK AND I HAVE BARELY EVEN 500 FOLLOWERS COMBINING ALL MY SOCIALS ... HUMILIATING ISN'T IT ?
my high school mems honestly just consist of getting bullied, havin mental health issues n popular girls coming up to my friends and calling all of them pretty apart from me rip
Bullies from my school be like: welcome to my YouTube channel
These quarantine dreams are getting weird. Last night I dreamt that I ran into two girls that bullied me in high school at a Four Tet concert. The dream ended with me in a fist fight with one of them. Donâ€™t worry I won.
I honestly donâ€™t remember if I dreamt this or not but one time a childhood bully told my bf that I never smiled during primary school and my bf said â€œmaybe there was nothing for her to smile aboutâ€ AND BRUH THE CLAP BACK
I made a profile on a dating app for sapphic girls and itâ€™s great but also so many of the girls on there look like they would have bullied you for being gay in high school
this has always been silly to me. Schools have always been training grounds to how to deal with life, including bullies. But we have become a pathetic people too sensitive to deal with anything
I feel like I'm back in High school drama club where this freak girl was bullied like mad and these are all the bullies trying to be do gooders now.
F*ck thatâ€™s awful. I was bullied in high school by both girls and boys who were supposed to be my friends. Bullies are weak and insecure and take it out in others. As hard as it is, heâ€™s got you in his corner and Iâ€™m sure he knows it.
An example: A girl who bullied me with dead pig parts in high school (yes... think Carrie) reaches out and apologized in our twenties. I accepted her apology and we had a lovely talk. We are friends on Instagram. Lol. It really was healing to have that harm acknowledged.
That Colgate ad about "Chhota packet, Bada packet" actually tells how much Bullying is prevalent in Schools. But Sure brush your teeth and Get Confident, get Witty with Bullies
mlm is a dangerous word cause it could be gay or be something that girl that bullied you in high-school trying to sell you snake oil

Ishida Shouya bullies a deaf girl, Nishimiya Shouko, to the point that she transfers to another school. As a result, he is ostracized and bullied himself with no friends to speak of and no plans for the future. This is the story of his path to redemption. Â°
hello, it's-a me - a girl who bullied you in high school. pls join my pyramid scheme
You can't. My high school bullied got me shunned for a year this way. Which fits. The media acts like 14 year old girls.
I was bullied as a kid because I was different I was born club feet. But my parents corrected my feet. Junior high I met a girl mentally challenge due to an accident we became friends. A girl was after
thinking about how in high school i let a group of incels under 5â€™6 bully me
And GO Fest comes to a close. My big wins from the weekend. I played much more the second day. Also got a 13-15-15 Shadow Mawile after hunting down that bespectacled admin all day like a high school bully. (I just wanted shiny Mawile.)
I just remembered that time this girl who constantly bullied me through high school called me and threatened me saying she knows where I live and when I reported it to school they were like .... so like Uhm why did you pick up from a restricted phone number though ? Iâ€™m
I swear the majority of drama school staff are just miserable sad actors who stopped getting work and now just bully the next generations trying to have a career. When I was at E15, the heads of course literally pit students against each other, saying other courses were shit.
itâ€™s always the nursing majors that were bitches in high school all the girls who bullied me are going into nursing school
getting bullied on royale high because just saying " INTO THE UNKNOW~~~~~~~~" The boy said : Can you shutup? I wanna make she shush rn I just tell him a joke bout vsco girl i was like I gtg I have a big business doing a big hydro flask their was like WHO CARES??
The awkward moment when a girl who ruthlessly bullied you and made your life hell in high school and even for a few years after tries to be your friend on Facebook lol looks like her life has gone downhill tho she has three kids and all different baby daddies.
If you like her you must be. Sheâ€™s a horrible person. Or havenâ€™t you lIstened to the tapes? How many kids did you used to bully at school?
STOP THIS! STOP! This cultural appropriation is getting to such a high point of wtf. I got BULLIED IN SCHOOL FOR DRESSING IN MY CULTURAL CLOTHES (properly) AND THESE STUPID WHITE GIRLS ARE DOING THIS?! This hurts my heart so fucking much. Also her underwear looks weird.
probably got bullied by girls in high shool lol

says the racist cracker with the r slur in his bio tell the popular kids who bully u in high school I say thanks
Y'all for real are one of the major problems of society today. If there is no form of discipline, there is no order or respect. "Kids" out there being bullies, shooting up schools, murdering others is the result of a weak parent. Period. Spank your kids.
Maybe I faired better as girl? I have no idea. But I really only remember being bullied by asshole mid teen girls in Middle School. High School I wasn't popular but no one treated me like shit or anything either. I had my specific friend group I hung out with and that was it
This is not even a man. He is really a high school girl feeling bullied. Geez this digust me.
when the â€œprettyâ€ girls that bullied you in middle/high school are still hoeing around getting played by guys that they think loves them..karma is the baddest bitch baby

vsco girls are the ones who bullied me in middle/high school for being unconventional and then as soon as being weird and quirky became a trend, they LOVED me
Some girl who bullied me in high school posted a quote about not calling people racist on her story. It was attributed to Ronald Reagan. Cool stuff.
2/2 and scrolled over your Instagram picture without liking it and told you it was because Iâ€™ve hit my like limit for the day . Please start making awake on Instagram into so much more this is why girls still get bullied in high school bc â€œinsta likesâ€
I remember my primary school days at Mater Misericodiae Nursery and Primary School Nyanya Abuja.. I was feared ooo The bully of the class. I been dey beat boys wella Its just so sad that I have lost my fighting skills
There is nothing they could have done which would have excused this behavior by the police. You are victim blaming. How would you feel if the police did that to your kids? These cops have less self control an average middle school school yard bully.
hacked stop leaving your twitter up 2 fucking school idiot
Those girls would have bullied her for even looking at them, have y'all never been to high school?
the girl that bullied me in high school told me that i was going to get cancer... a few years later SHE got cancer and thatâ€™s on karma

I remember I lowkey bullied this girl in 5th grade and she tried to get her high school sister to scare me. Like wtf are you really gonna do other than mean mug me at pick up, Lora!?
Why Wolves fans would have "a pop" at each other is beyond me? People who understand that a young lad from Smethwick chose to support Wolves in 1972, to appose school bullies, will understand the pride I feel during the last 3 seasons. These are moments we dreamt of!
those tweets that say â€œgirls that suddenly like *insert interest* bullied me in high schoolâ€, are totally right because i wouldve bullied myself for how iâ€™m acting rn, but thatâ€™s called growth baby
In elementary school, I was called â€œMoustache Womanâ€ and â€œUnibrow Girlâ€... honestly it wasnâ€™t even that bad. In high school, I was bullied for being a lesbian... and Iâ€™m not even a lesbian.
Frankie and Peaches help Ruby, the new girl at school, find the courage to be herself and stand up to bullies. The Pancake Girl is an inspirational story that shows how a small act of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life. #KidLit https://amzn.to/2YvUF7d â—„

Her tweet has the same energy as gabby Hannah screaming about her high school fucking bullies
In high school (ages 15/16 to 18/19) the mean girls bullied and ostracised a friend of mine for... Being a Christian, being shy and quiet and not talking, being smart in school... Mocked her clothes too I think (her family didnt have a lot of money)... Assholes.
because thereâ€™s a 9/10 chance ur about to run ur 3rd grade teacher and also ur middle school bully
the girls who bullied me in high school coming into my dms to try n sell me avon products is actually funny as fuck no lie
I was bullied in junior high, my oldest daughter was bullied in elementary school and my youngest now in a new middle school is having a hard time with it. The sorry thing is most mean girls just grow up to be mean unhappy women.
Just another of the infinite examples of Trump's intellectual and emotional capacity - that if an 8th grade bully. He couldn't get elected student body president of any middle school!
ur all bullies..high school fucking bullies

someone did the maid of honor of the girl who bullied you in high school and it was so good lmao
men & descent women reject anti male feminist misandry from gold digger Cortez. She acts like a cry baby in the school yard, blaming the bully boy with lies promoting herself &amp; motivating bias against the boy &amp; all boys - this is a Pelosi style hate crime against all men @POTUS
I once mildly bullied a girl in our first year of high school in 1983. I also didn't defend her against other bullies. I remember that day and the incident vividly. I apologised to her c. 1992 at my sister's wedding. I am still mortified to this day
This one group of guys from my high school would always do this and would even moan the last name of a girl they bullied
thereâ€™s a thing that goes around â€œthose girls who bullied you in high school are probably nurses nowâ€ guess we found out what the male bullies are now
My girls are bullied and I have been to the school, changed schools and it still goes on. Itâ€™s everywhere. The most severe is my jr high child. This one girl is horrible. She bullies so many. She told my daughters ng to kill herself. She tortured, stalks my daughter. I texted her
fucking high school bullies !!
The whole world is racist. His previous school was dangerous and this one had 1 bully and a better education.
The fact that @sydhightower is telling you to â€œplease try and hurt another contestantâ€.... GIRL. I am speechless Sydney needs to get off her high horse. Sheâ€™s no better than the â€œmean girlsâ€ sheâ€™s claimed bullied her for that statement.
So u'll bully ppl online 4 being non deserving, rather than bust ppl who r criminals?? This isn't high school, v need 2 grow up. U pointed out once her role wz undeserving of an award, true. Ppl already saw she wz dumb in d KwK show. Nw go after hardcore criminals n gang leaders!
Iâ€™m not sure non-Black folks know how commonly it is evoked. I remember being bullied by a girl in high school from Tennessee who called my house, asked for me, &amp; before my mother could hang up said, â€œyou know we hang yâ€™all from trees where Iâ€™m from.â€ I mean...that was the 1990s.
re lrt being bullied by pretty girls all my life was also such great help (not) in figuring out im actually bisexual like i look at attractive women and im like i think im attracted to you but years of abuse makes me think you wouldve thrown rotten food at me in high school uwu
The majority of these people are guys or girls who were bullied or beaten up in high school. This lines up the desire of power trip and better even with everyone
Not only jerks, but bullies. The Democrats are the party of cheap shot grade school bullies.
Lol we high key conditioned for it. I actually never wanted to be married but was bullied for being gay starting 6th grade cause I wasnâ€™t hell bent over any boy. Then pressured to being more like a girl. + what you see on tv ++ your parents actually set you up the most for it
LDHSISJSISJ HIGH SCHOOL FUCKING BULLIES YOU ARE RIGHT
- new class and then this girl just interrupted me and said "you're gay" in front of everybody I never got bullied or anything and yet that ONE MOMENT was the turning point for ruining the first half of high school for me. kids are so mean and for WHAT?!?!
Lol girls who actually bullied me in high school said this to me at my high school reunion!
One more thing. #Bully I was bullied in school. One girl who bullied me in high school, came up pregnant the next year. I actually felt sorry for her. She became a Mom at 16.
Why are yâ€™all so into girls who looked like they bullied you in high school? I look like Iâ€™d bully you now is that not enough?
When girls who bullied you in high school now become your fans
No offense to shauni , but I do think she rides high on the fact that she's a producer. It's like if you DNT fwh .. you get bullied . Ive always disliked the mean girl mentality #basketballwives
Mr Ajit u can only brawl on tweeter as bully school boy
How about we just focus on the big one. You know the one where he is teaching his "boys" to bully women because he is a "man" and that is what "men" do to women! Nice lesson "Robert" now they can go out and bully their female classmates when they all go to school. What fun? Nice?
This girl I went to high school with just had a baby. She named it Kylo. But NOT because of Star Wars. She genuinely liked the name and thought it was cool. This kid gonna be bullied in school over Star Wars and that wasnâ€™t even the point. Wild.
Iâ€™m glad to see some of the girls who bullied me in high school have finally turned to our lord and savior the Amethyst

if it's any consolation there's a good chance your high school bully is tangled up in a weird dietary supplement pyramid scheme that nobody's heard of
Old enough to remember when school, church, TV, films taught young people a sense of fairness--why are "the devout" so devoted to the Braggart-in-chief whose every deadly word/action is antiChrist/American? Just one thing he has said/done that isn't to bully, insult, lie, boast?
I've been bullied in high school myself by other girls. I always had no friends, I used to be super quiet and hide in the library so I wouldn't get my clothes ripped off me again. Glad to see this kid punch that fucker, I know what it is like.
The guy who fingered me on the back of a motorcycle is dating a girl B bullied in high school
And this is your response? Comforting messages from strangers with a passing interest? Sort it out dad, this is the point you do something. Go to the school, talk to the teachers, threaten the bullies parents. Come on, sort it out man
Ok I would be the mosher kid that would get bullied for being different but then said bullies would dress like me and want to be friends outside of school........ah the flash backs
Does Jim Jordan really think not wearing a suit coat makes him look manly if so someone should inform him that he looks like a disrespectful child breaking the dress code in middle school! Heâ€™s just a big mouth bully who makes little sense,
I'm glad to see all the bullies I loathed in high school finally got jobs. (I guess the mob didn't want them.)
Nigga nyc is bad! The all Black schools will bully u worse than these white kids about your Black features and color and theyâ€™ll be just as bad if u Lightskinned and â€œlook/act/talkâ€ white. Also if u are non-American in ethnicity (or have an accent or foreign look) tuh
Man spank your kids... please teach them a lesson early cause if your kid come out bad and try to bully mine heâ€™s gonna sleep that boy and I donâ€™t want to have to come to school and take time out of my day because my kid had to teach your kid a lesson that you failed to teach him
Thinking bout that time a girl in year 7 was manipulated into sending her bf vids of her fingering herself which he screen recorded and sent round the entire school and she was bullied for the rest of high school and everyone avoided her but praised the lad ok
I had some girls do that to me in high school, it didnâ€™t make any sense. They later told me they did it so i would look less weird and uncool. Made zero sense lmao. They just got bullied for it and when they tried to take it no one believed them
@Rileyyz_69 stupid fuck, riley isn't allowed to use any kind of social networking, jog on you bum bandit
Every school yard bully ever "What's the matter? Can't you take a joke?"
Heyy anfal, children are innocent creatures and they will listen to you because you are the adult and they look up to you. As an adult you mustnâ€™t promote such behaviors like being rude about someoneâ€™s appearance/ looks. If this goes on her daughter will be a bully in school.
Tell me why I just remembered out of nowhere that like during my first ever week of college some dude told me I looked like the type of girl who bullied people in high school Iâ€™m triggered
I 've never seen such an overly-entitled toddler tantrum bullshit review from a supposed professional before. It reads like a high school mean girl post she bullied the schools newsletter into including coz she mad about something
Walked into the room to see two girls that bullied in high school....I was not expecting that
why are we scared of bullies in school???? they're literally 14 and 4 ft tall
Teen violence is increasing, About thirty percent of middle school and high school aged children are bullied or are a bully themselves. Boys are more likely than girls to carry a gun into a school. The second leading cause of death in teens and young adults is homicide.
Im gonna bully my philosophy teacher with this question as soon as we get back to school
When I was 12 I shit my pants during baseball practice. I went and sat down to hide the big shit stain on my white pants. A baseball landed a foot from me and I refused to grab it. The biggest bully in school came over. Took one look at me...said "dont worry I got it".
I had horrible dreams last night about high school and a girl who I was friends with who then bullied me but everyone took her side. I have hated myself in the past for still sometimes having dreams about this at 29 but when I spoke to that psychologist she said that dreams are
This is very true. It's all about silencing you! They were probably bullies in school too.
I get bullied so much in Royale high by those mean girls :((
Bro I swear if I was other person and went to the same school as me I would bully the shit out of myself LOL
just miss pancetti & i hiding from my high school bully
Itâ€™s insane to me how many girls are coming out about being slut shamed &amp; getting their nudes exposed yet a lot of them &amp; their bfs bullied me in high school &amp; teased me about it. No one spoke up for me. If you were silent when my name was mentioned you were a part of the problem
The Trump click of GOP high school bullies is despicable and an embarrassment to America.
People keep talking about being bullied and it's like... why aren't we talking about stopping bullying? I was that kid in elementary school. I'd rather the bullies be stopped, much as I hated PE.
that blonde cheerleader looks just like a girl who used to bully me in elementary school ldfjsldjf
Donâ€™t you remember primary school and bullies were given a time out?
You can't convince us that LAFC is not subbing in two young actors in LA who exclusively play high school bullies.
A lot of the bully's from high school aren't smart enough for university so they join the police department where they continue their bullying from high school. The scary part is now they have guns.
I joined the menâ€™s golf team in high school as the only girl and I donâ€™t know what possessed me to do that as I was already bullied AND I didnâ€™t know how to golf.
I remember in junior high I was about the most hated girl in school for no literal reason what so ever. I was bullied every single day and the worst part of it all is that my English was so mediocre to the point that I couldnâ€™t even defend myself. Those days broke me like nothing
For a big tough guy trump does a lot of whinnying! Trump has the mentally of a five year old. That is how he fights like a bully in the school yard. He is a scared child trying desperately not to be found out. He's been a fake his whole life. Trump is an empty barrel.
â€œAnti-Semiticâ€ is a buzzword invented by j**s to silence anyone who is pointing out bad j**ish behavior. Just think of it like the school bully making words that shame people who call out the bully or try to report him to the principals office
At the rate that black people are getting murdered by cops, I feel like all them cops got bullied by black kids when growing up or got rejected by a black girl in high school.
@gauravbh sir u would be the last person to hear this clip. Don't make a fool of urself on national television and then u act like a school bully by the caption Rahul pappu. Pathetic.

EDM twitter is worse than the bullies back in school that they claim to hate so much
I knew this girl in high school who got bullied for wearing cat ears and a tail everywhere
Welcome to The Standard, where the prices are high and the standards are low. Sign a lease today! Or be bullied by the sorority girl at the front desk.
I became a Cancer the day that instead of fighting I went on some long ass diatribe talking to my bully in elementary school about how my feelings matter. Sigh.
the girl who bullied u in high school 100% runs a disney fashion Instagram now
Cass is every girl who bullied me in high school except now we're old af and she hasn't changed #BachelorInParadiseAU
High school/middle school bullies will be the very vocal people in the fandom and then boom crazy teenage girls stereotype are back
She's the girl u bullied in high school
My sis was a good kid, but she had issues into High School. Once she had gotten into a serious fight with a girl who decided to bully her. Nikki (my sis) won the fight and put her in line, but Principal Victoria was /pissed/, especially when my Dad said he wasnâ€™t upset with Nikki
help not at how my irl used to bully people for stuff like that and is now an anime stan after weâ€™ve finished at school lmfaooooo
All these judgments is all you hear from the media. Ever notice not one somewhatintellectual articleon the effects of his policies? Its a 24/7 bashing contest. And the sheep eat it up, like school kids being deceived by a bully to cause trouble. Wake up, you are being played
Secondary study: girls who bullied in high school who marry military
@RepTedYoho I have to tell you Ted with the last name YOHO people shouldnâ€™t expect more from you. Youâ€™re one of those guy that didnâ€™t have a violin high school. School bully you &amp; put you in locker with your underwear in your head.Remember the name YOHO.ALEXANDRIA OCASIO CORTES !
Yes call me names to prove that Iâ€™m the school yard bully
AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY We're going in with brand new mission. Playing DBD like it's an old school conviction. Sorry the rhyme I hope it's not a crime :^) Ok I'm sorry http://twitch.tv/tallertoast (It's monday don't bully)
She seems to display many of the traits of a school bully. Not pleasant.
This girl who looked like a man bullied the fuck out of me in high school bc she was homophobic. I strongly suspect this is the problem.
shawdd was one of my high school bullies so i fucked her and never talking to her again feels great #ftb
Wow, her husband was NOT having their sh*t. Damn, it.s too bad there weren't 45 of them, They could've taken the whole lot of them down like bowling pins. That poor woman. IMO these guys aren't trained in anything. They're ex high school bullies that couldn't pass the cop exam.
Eric ....Nadler is a very sick man who should not be in this position and he is as immature as a school yard mad dog bully. Everyone's got his number.
So this tiny girl was bullied with mere words and she's creating all this noise. Some of us were physically bullied in high xul &amp; we didn't even mention a word. Sheila Komanyoko yiven
They were bullies in school who played football and miss having power over others. So they became cops to continue to abuse and have power. They couldn't handle real jobs so they became cops that the hardest thing they need is a GED.
Right, youâ€™re the same one who says that you went to high school with him, but he declined and then he bullied you! Girl bye
His comment was indeed cuntish. But to be honest, you don't seem to be a great deal better. What sort of man makes a fake account harassing and insulting a woman who works for the NHS? Making fake accounts mocking people is what mean-spirited bullies do at school. Congrats.
Seriously, Scott?! You honestly believe that if Joe Biden is elected this just goes away? It will get worse my friend! God, if a civil war breaks out next week? What would you do? Look at it like this. It's the high school bully scenario all over again.
when the biggest bullies in high school wanna call out bullying
the girl who bullied me in high school is still in the same class as me and she's like the favourite of this goddamn teacher and she gets amazing grades too i fucking hate life
#ComingOutDay itâ€™s scary to think how different the world was 10 years ago.. Me and my girlfriend used to literally get followed by people asking us to kiss @high school we got bullied so bad and werenâ€™t allowed in the girls changing rooms.
Because you then get a mouthful from their aunt at the school gate. Iâ€™ve never come closer to thumping another adult. She was 5ft nothing &amp; though bringing up children to bully anyone different was OK.
In junior high I had a classmate, Bruce, whom many of the other boys mercilessly bullied because of his distinctly feminine behavior. One day in the locker room, after a particularly brutal round of bullying, he said, between piteous sobs, â€œI wish I could be a girl.â€ Do you /1
4 hours at Mugg n Bean during my school holidays, the barristas were such bullies and everyone was walking on eggshells cause the big boss was so strict. I left during my lunch break. Went back a week later to collect my coins - R67
Strangely enough, the girl who bullied me through middle school and high school became a friend of mine on Facebook, and doesnâ€™t even remember she used to bully me.
My mind boggles at the stupidity of sending children under 10 years old back to a physical school, during a pandemic. They donâ€™t understand physical boundaries, lack the attention span to keep a mask on all day, and bullies would be running around, pulling off masks &amp; coughing.
seeing the girls that bullied me throughout middle school and high school happy makes me smile. like yea you might be one of the reasons for my depression , but i would never want to see you sad like i am :,)
they look like the type of ppl who would bully me in middle school
I scrutinise pictures to check for people who used to bully me in school and evidence of erections. Social distancing... not so much
This song really hits different after knowing the story about CY got bully in his middle school days for his short height. I also had faces same situation, exactly in middle school days as well for my fat body and round face face.
â €â €â € â €â €â € â €â € â €â €â € â I'm a tough woman . Well it's kinda hardcore . But whatever you say . While at high school , I was an outcast and I was heavily bullied by some Ganguro girls . Ganguros are tan Japanese girls with weird fashion sense . I couldn't handle the -
Cody need to bring his fat ass to school !
oh I had a few bullies â€¢Christopher (my motherâ€™s VERY abusive ex). you werenâ€™t even my bio dad you trash heap get on outta here stop hitting me &gt;:( â€¢Alias. You bit my Nan wtf dude â€¢Daniel. You were just plain nasty &gt;:( â€¢all of Springfield elementary school coz Iâ€™m autistic
Oxford Laboratory recently released news that two-dose vaccination production is well underway. The first dose will be via injection, the second dose is getting whomped in the stomach by Butch DeLoca, my high school bully.
Childish... on both sides. Like a bunch of school kids wanna bully each other back and forth not caring that EVERYONE is effected by it.
this is high school bully
man middle school bullies never change
Girl same, I use to beat boys for a loving in middle school amd high school. Got bullied by girls that called themselves my friends at one point. Ugh....and now well.....they ain't doing so well.
It actually needs to be re-populated because itâ€™s IMPOTENT. They are cowards of the worst kind. Scared of the school-yard bully and unable to do their jobs. Name something of value the Trump-GOP has done in 2020. WAS IT WORTH THE SOUL OF THE NATION?
i hate trump and everything about him, but bullying can lead people to suicide my cousin was bullied so bad at school at attempted suicide twice and itâ€™s not really a joke no one deserves that itâ€™s better to educate than bully then people will actually listen
tw fatphobia + medical conditions + death / anyway remember when i was a freshmen in high school and this guy i was "friends" with said i would die of a heart attack bc of my weight. anyway i think, legally, i should be allowed to bully men
My parents and siblings stay roasting me for no reason. Mind you I'm a master at the comebacks due to people TRYING to bully me at school before i shut them down . So my comebacks be making my siblings cry and my parents reevaluate their entire process leading to my existence.
Soc media contributes to bullying n such a harmful way- its so sad. I was bullied by a black girl in my Jr. high- "get out of the game with your striped hair you can't turn rope". Me: f_ k you I'm staying ( I had friends in that game and she was new). That's how it went.
I was bullied from kindergarten, to prep school to high school . Been rough for a black girl Yet still I rise.
I got bullied by girls constantly in multiple high schools. I always ended up hanging out with the guys bc of that. I think that harassment definitely comes more from men but bullying is not specific to one gender. Girls are freaking savage. Especially teenage ones.
If you donâ€™t send your kids back to school weâ€™re not funding any schools. If you donâ€™t go on back to work we are not allowing a payroll tax cut. If you donâ€™t do what we say we are sending our goonsquad. This is the new playground. This is the bully world order.
this is why we canâ€™t have anything nice straight tiktok takes EVERYTHING from us and now no control- like if youâ€™re gonna disrespect the boys atleast do it right. definetely the people whoâ€™d bully 1D fans in school for stanning them only cause itâ€™s â€˜trendyâ€™ now
The fact that girls who would have bullied me in high school for getting my hair cut short are now allowed to say queer as much as they want bc of queer eye and act like they're allies should be illegal
Itâ€™s 2020 and private school kids still bully? HCA Iâ€™m talking about yâ€™all.
I wore high waisted lavender shorts to my cousins 14th birthday party today and her friends called me a VSCO girl I- .... was I just bullied?
i donâ€™t trust scrunchie girls. i feel like they wouldâ€™ve bullied me in high school
Y'all be arguing over the E-girls and sending them money and tryna eat their pussy through the Mic But in reality, they all look like the girls you would have bullied in high school or vomited at if they tried to kiss you -- shake my head
female rappers that sound like high school bullies &gt;&gt;&gt;
order to properly convey my emotions and nobody even bats an eye and most people at my school won't say anything to me but they're always like " I would never bully an autistic/disabled kid" and then bully me for showing autistic traits and behaviours that they consider "weird"+
Considering brexiters will block anyone who won't follow their narratives, you get no moral high ground. Plus, you bullied a teenage girl. You don't deserve the respect to be listened too. Get over yourself.
girls who try to sell their pyramid scheme products to people they bullied in high school should be banned from the internet
Please don't let people commit #suicide. I lost my younger brother to suicide. He killed himself because he was being #bullied.Support #gays
At all the girls who bullied people in high school, thatâ€™s why your fat now
Living out ur high school bully fantasies online is praxis now
Awwww. The school yard bully thinks itâ€™s unfair. What goes around comes around
I had a meeting with my old roommate about how dirty she left the kitchen,etc. and the first thing she did was start crying and saying she got bullied in high school. I just stared at her. Like girl I DONT CARE. Iâ€™ve seen this first hand. Those tears are their weapons.
Why do people loved to bully others? Yeah it does felt good, I've done it once at elementary school, but after a while I felt bad and eventually became friends with them. I guess I still got karma'd at junior high school which is 3 years of pure depression.
thinking about how my sophomore year a girl who bullied me in junior high wrote her final essay on my google drive then blamed me for not signing out then asked me to send it to her and i just said â€œsucksâ€
Yeah it does. And I hear about it happening a lot in the US. Like dark skinned black girls will get bullied, even by other dark skinned black boys in high schools, so they grow up with that still affecting them. I think it's really sad and doesn't even make sense.
Iâ€™m pissed off MOSTLY because of the shirt. It screams â€œPyramid scheme girl who bullied you in high schoolâ€
Laughing pretty hard at the girls from my high school reposting the â€œif you notice someone getting bullied please be their friendâ€ post like they WERENT THE BIGGEST BULLIES IN HIGH SCHOOL. We see you, we remember.
Iâ€™m watching a review of Tall Girl, and as a certified Tall Girl This is the most overdramatic thing ive ever seen...in high school I got bullied for basically everything EXCEPT being tall.
You're a dude who got bullied by a girl in high school lmao rope
She's the first of our heroes to be ride or die Luna Lovegood. Anyone who can see that that girl is an absolute treasure is a High Quality Individual. Plus she stands up for people being bullied since BEFORE SHE WENT TO HOGWARTS when she yells at Malfoy for Harry. Heart of GOLD
im not tryna be mean but some artists really be drawing gyro and johnny like the white girls that bullied me in high school
As a black girl in high school I was demonzined and bullied, to this day I am dealing the trauma and pain of that treatment and disassociating from the stigmaz placed upon me by society and mosty black boys
first anime and now chubbies, middle school sam's bullies lookin real dumb right now
I have some long, drawn out thoughts about Gabbie Hannah. She reminds me of the girl in high school that people bullied because itâ€™s easy bully her. Itâ€™s a shitty thing to say, but it is very obvious that is what is happening. I canâ€™t remember any specific information about what
Made it a living hell and I'm sure I'd made my social skills less than optimal until high school. I was the bullied by the boy that liked said girl but I kiked that boys ass and then his friends asses. Ganing then 2 years of not talking to no one but one intendent don Pedro.
The same girls who bullied me for my Carrie Underwood standom in middle school and high school are the same girls seeing photos of my performance with her and saying â€œWoW iM sO haPPy FoR yOU. YOu kiLLeD iT.â€ Imagine how tired I am.
It's sad when a person feels the need to make fun of someone's disability. He's no better than a school yard bully. Such childish behavior. What a disgrace to our country. November can't get here fast enough.
I like how you portray the rioters and looters as protestors. Its kinda like when the school bully beats the shit out of the small kid, and then blames the small kid for starting a fight when caught. You don't have the stones to own your own bullshit.
Thought I could name my inner saboteur after my high-school bully. However, his name was Free; the wrong vibe for an inner saboteur.
The most aggravating part of it to me would be when they say â€œ The girls that weâ€™re the bullies in high school are the girls who are nurses.â€ When itâ€™s not like that at all. I was actually bullied in school. Iâ€™m a medical assistant now working on my degree. I hate stereotypes.
Fucking Burnley like the little shit in school hiding behind the bullies
The way girls that dressed like this in middle/high school got bullied and now itâ€™s â€œcottagecore chicâ€
I went to an all boys school. Hockey... it gives me the fear. It was just an opportunity for bullies to hit a puck at you with force. Or just directly hit you with the stick. I was slight in size as a boy and always felt inferior to the other boys. Although I did enjoy rugby
u seem like the type of girl that would have bullied me in high school
@TedYoho AOC made you look like a bum baby shitting itâ€™s pants in your apology. Totally lackluster. Totally missing the bigger point. You have respect. Middle school bullies have better tactics than you.
In a moment where I feel so small and forgotten, someone random girl from high school reached out and thanked me for not letting her be bullied by her ex who was manipulative and toxic and also the boy who everyone worshipped. People know when you see them. The end.
i had a bully called ryan in my old high school and he was really homophobic and so whenever he would punch me, i'd just loudly moan and say harder daddy. he stopped after his friends overheard the second time
Ooh good one. Did you bully other girls with that uno-reverse-card shit in high school? I'm just saying. If you can't handle being called out for making dumb ass comments, it's your fault for making them, not mine for telling you they're dumb as hell.
I bet this â€œlil niggaâ€ guy that we both blocked each other is trying to find a way to argue and trash talk me again honestly what a depressed kid heâ€™s trying to snitch on me like itâ€™s an expose, i can tell he has no friends at school and his hobby is to bully / harrass people
how come every girl that bullied me in high school is now in nursing school
this girl who bullied me and called me fat bitch throughout high school literally is heavier than i was when she was making fun of me. i celebrated when i found out. that bitch used to take my lunches away telling me "the pig needs to be controlled"
I remember slap ass Friday at our middle school. I never participated, but I also never stopped those guys (sorry, I was bullied. But I do remember feeling super uncomfortable in high school when this girl put her hand up the back of my shirt and like rubbed my back in the hall.
I was bullied harshly as a teen. I didn't walk into my school and kill people to get back at my bullies.
Very true â€” his bully tactic seems to be finding a weakness in a person and then using a grade school taunt to bully them about it [or at least a *perceived* weakness].
These are BULLIES. These are high school fucking BULLIES.
I remember the three years I spent in that girls' school. Those senior bullies were terrors. I'm forever proud of every single prank and mini punishment I pulled on them.
Someone needa get this @myquotes_swag bitch talking about my dead family members. Ill sho her ass cyber bullying!
Literally not what iâ€™m saying, you should read the thread again. I said heâ€™s shit and a scumbag and we should call him out without turning into middle school bullies. Youâ€™re understanding what you want to understand.
I didnâ€™t even know what call her daddy was before this week but Iâ€™m 100% sure that the girls on the podcast would have bullied me in high school
I had short hair in middle school and people would question my gender. In high school I got bullied for dating a girl, by the kids in school and parts of my family.
Do you know how many women worked at my gamestop? 0. For the 6 years I went there. Do you know how many women in my family of 72 gamed? 1 and it was bc she grew up with brothers? Do you know how many times I was bullied in high school by girls? Every day.
high school FUCKING BULLIES
Hey girl, so glad I found you on Facebook! Remember me? Itâ€™s Britany from High school! I bullied you mercilessly for 4 years? Iâ€™m looking for people who want to succeed and like a challenge for my new business! Want to join my team of entrepreneurial ladies?
I was bullied badly in high school about a guy I was dating. He was new in town and chose me, the quiet band geek. One girl even teamed up with his ex to stalk me and took pics of us at dances. When we broke up it was even worse. He dumped me for that ex &amp; they gave me hell.
Let your daughter know she'll get through this. I was mercilessly bullied until I got to high school. I cried daily and had crippling anxiety, getting a stomachache every morning on the way to school. But, it gets better, and I now know how pathetic those girls were.
Girl just so lame!!! All this hostility ... you taking it out on me but I wasnâ€™t the one of the pretty bitches who bullied you in high school but if you wanna be me, itâ€™s okay . Hit the dm &amp; Iâ€™ll slide you an autograph baby walrus
Bullies attack anyone who doesn't go along, and their loyalists will usually join in. This is the same scenario we warn our kids about in grade school. Anyone notice the anti bullying PSAs of Obama era are gone? Probably because they speak to trumps behavior so directly.
Iâ€™m confused on where she even mentioned race in the tweet Â¿ and also idk how someone who bullied a girl in high school for not wanting to do camo day for owl week can even speak
Ferrets are such majestic creatures. Except my roommate's. He's an asshole
And threaten violence against anyone who does not worship their â€œchosen oneâ€ i.e., the orange man. Apparently Trumpers r incapable of forming their own opinions or making their own decisions. Itâ€™s the â€œhigh schoolâ€ mentality - they think its â€œcoolâ€ to hide behind a bully. Stupid.
Hopefully itâ€™s been a while since you thought about prom, bullies, and who you sat with in the high school cafeteria. But â€” please, donâ€™t panic here â€” your teenage social life could be affecting how much money youâ€™re making now. http://www.thrivewealth.ca.advisor.news/sigh-popular-kids-earn-more-money-adults-new-research-suggests/?c=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJub2RlX2lkIjoxMTIzMSwicHJldmlldyI6ZmFsc2UsImNvbW1faWQiOjI0NDcwMTIsImRlc3RfaWQiOjMzNTM0Nzl9.r1EAr9njDw4DMr5t4bSCNJoVZJ6vjuAh5r_hyJQOWwg
the venn diagram of girls who bullied people in high school and girls who rt these pics is a circle
Girls that start tweets with this bullied me in high school
That's a valid view but there are other valid views too. One of which is that the way to stop racist bullying in school is to exclude racist bullies. This is a place for debate and discussion and challenge and nobody sets the rules (beyond some very basic ones).
I've had a lot of experience; I've been telling off my brother's bullies since I started wee school. Once rolled a 10yr old bully down a hill for picking on my brother (I was 5) hehe
By seizing the opportunity and making a deal out of school yard banter from a bully. Facing shame provoking exercises head on is true bravery. Try it sometime, grow a little.
I would like to respectfully disagree . As a nerd with a very high IQ in my youth I went for non-blacks primarily bc black boys/girls and men/women bullied me for being who I naturally was. So I SETTLED for whoever AT LEAST respected me as a person.
You were bullied and humiliated by the pretty girl in high school and now you pay a gorgeous woman to degrade and belittle you. findom | finD | humiliation | paypig
I loved her speech. Itâ€™s true that women put up with harassment all there lives and itâ€™s time for it to stop! Iâ€™m tired of listening to Republicans and especially our President acting like school yard bullies!
what if the school bully knew martial arts
Happy International Day of Friendship! To quote year 3 student St Felix, Bankstown student Ryana, "Being a bully is never okay. Invite them to come and play." If you see something wrong, you can always sing her song. https://bit.ly/2CTGH8H #bullyingnoway #FriendshipDay
girls who bullied me in high school are chronic pains now and im stirling
John said I could stay up later tonight because tomorrow's not a school day. So finally I can see the whole ABC Sunday Night at the Movies presentation of "Thunderball."
I was bullied in junior high school for having big ears and mock I even got into a fight with a girl at the cafeteria &amp; in senior high school I got bullied so hard I quit school until my uncle convince me to go back and deal with it
Not surprised I got bullied in middle school and high school for my looks, but still hold major grudges against those girls
bullies high school fucking bullies
Bullied when I was like 4 because the other kid needed a friend and didnâ€™t know how else to get attention. Bullied when I was 8 because the girl bullying me fancied me. Aaaand bulled again in high school for having long hair, being skinny, having some spots, glasses, being gay.
If only someone could school yard bully him by taking his phone away
Someone needs to tell social media users how high school turned out. Because In reality, post high school the cool kids now ainâ€™t shit. The prettiest girls went to become the least prettiest, the ugly kid glowed tf up, the bullied kids attained an awakening. Grow up.
Yeah. its disgusting- that girl maybe a little kid who just wanted to play royale high and got bullied by those girls..
School of killer bully turtles attack harmless gator.
leave Edski alone bully boy lol..... Thats his kevin n Perry get up!!! :P @rickyp1969 @vinylmasakist @acid_ash
I was bullied just for having too my friends that just happened to be girls. I got along with both boy &amp; girls in my friendship groups they mainly consisted of girls. I got told that I should be a girl if I hang out with them &amp; I'm embarrassment to the boys in high school..
Your right I was that girl that bullied you in high school. Iâ€™m still that b* tch FinD findom
Yes, he got bullied. Ya know, just like how you got bullied in high school for having a girls name.
Jimmy Wilkins , the school bully
Sorry I donâ€™t have any. A bully at my school took my iPad and deleted all my apps, including procreate :(
These protesters are the result of 30 years of Communist Socialist Indoctrination by the Public Schools and Universities... They teach AMERICA is just the Racist Bully and not the Rock of Freedom. Liberty and Justice. Bring back the Draft for mandatory Service to our Country !
stay kind, it makes you beautiful shares the girl who bullied me excessively in high school
Lmao at all the mean girls from high school retweeting the â€œyou were born pretty, I was bullied into being pretty we are not the sameâ€ tweet. EXCUSE ME?!?! NO YOU WERENT. You were pretty growing up. YOU were the ones that bullied OTHER girls. So stop fronting. Itâ€™s ugly
She used to punch the high school bullies who made of fun of him for being gay.
Generations of their leader,s never mentally left the school yard. Either the bossy prefect or yard bully syndrome infected them.
In high school I was a "practice girl," meaning the dudes who bullied me went on to be charged with domestic violence
it so messed up it's like ANTIFA is the school bully the police are the ones being bullied and the mayor is the crappy principle that lets it just keep happening day after day
I was bullied by a group of black girls in high school, who hit me, called me honky and white paddy; should we find them and ruin their lives and try to take away their livelihoods, or is it okay because I'm white. I hope they regret it. People change.
and thats getting the shit beat out of them, its why you never see a bully pick on someone that can kick their ass, everyone in my school knew everyone else would stand up for themselves or had friends hat would stand up for them so bullying was never an issue
In high school this girl I never associated with randomly started a rumor saying I bullied her in middle school because..she..was...a lesbian.
i have never been more bullied than my sophomore year of high school by senior girls i ainâ€™t ever talk to about some guy i liked on that shit, in my life
Tall girls (&amp;boys) got bullied in high school too, hey hi i am one and i definitely did, so it's real bizarre that this is the one film that suddenly has everyone rioting when there are so many with just ~awkward~ bland female leads you could've already started a revolution over
when I was in high school a stupid girl bullied me so badly and made me never want to show my face in school, then on her last day of school she came up to me to apologize and say â€œI was jealous of your styleâ€ lmao wut
I was always amongst those called to stay at the end of assembly coz of unpaid school fees. I even knew before they called the names that I was gona be there. Kids laughed but so what? We had bigger things to worry about, my dad also beat my mom so nje I was numb to bullies.
Edwin was the kind of nerd school bullies picked on as a kid. And then he hit puberty.
Just think... her kid goes to your sons school . I had a truck driver road rage at me recently and he videoed me as I kept driving. I was worried so contact the cops... they said, canâ€™t do much donâ€™t worry about it. Sheâ€™s just being a bully
I believe everyone should have free choice but remembering cruelty at school, where names could be used as an excuse to pick on someone by bullies I think it will sadly bring negative unwanted attention to the child for life. I'm not saying the parents are wrong, it's our world!
Not popular white girls but boys, got bullied hard, chanted high school, God less bullied but girls weren't to keen of the jumpy anxious girl with greasy hair. Their loss.
If this is â€œnurse humorâ€ it seems really in parallel with â€œall the girls in high school who bullied weird kids became nursesâ€ meme
The problem with that belief is that the more women they brutalize the more most men will see "law enforcement" types as the enemy. Face it.. as things stand right now, most people see "law enforcement" as overpaid high-school bullies. It is about to get far worse..
High school was the worst 4 years of my life! Some of the mean girls grow up to be mean women. I still get bullied for having g special needs. Thanks for sharing truth Maddie.
Still cannot believe in high school the girl who bullied me the most would consistently just name drop me on twitter and make fun of me, my singing, my talking about feminism etc. she treated me like garbage on public for social media for her friends to laugh at
Not lasting 30 seconds him in a Liverpool school have them astros taken off him and beat with them for being a bully
the girl who abused me knew me because she used to bully me in school. fucking slut, the only reason she was never expelled was because her rich parents said that they would stop giving the school money. i hate priveledged sluts like her, they deserve absolutely nothing
i really used to let people in CARGO SHORTS bully me in high/middle school. the fucking audacity.
Xbox niggas used to be the bullies now they getting swirlies in the toilets at school
Okay I just met one of my go workers and he is with the shit! My guy is 40, former punk rocker, tatted up from LA, and goes around and bullies cops and uplifts his diverse students. Said we are taking this school to the next level.
For me, it's actually a stay in hospital when I was 8. I got hit round the head with a cricket bat at school by a bully and spent 4 days in hospital, the thing that got me through it was that they had a Mega Drive that I could play Sonic on
hey i know everyone is listening to the new taylor swift album right not, but does anyone wanna come bully some straights in this kid from my schools tiktok comments?
Man, I shoulda bullied girls in high school
Fasho gone be doing that for my kids. I'ma find the school bully and let them square up with my kid when they gone wanna act right
David Piper has always been an outsider. His parents think he's gay. The school bully thinks he's a freak. Only his 2 best friends know the real truth.David wants to be a girl. On the first day at his new school Leo Denton has one goal - to be invisible #SummerReads #MondayVibes
all of the girls that bullied me in high school now have kids lol,,, praying for their children.
How do you respond to your bully in school trying to friend you on Facebook? 32 years and I still hate his guts.
theyâ€™re dressed like the girls who would have bullied me in high school
We all know men have high standards how a woman should look like. And the girl was pretty. That she got bullied alright but that happens to a lot of people &amp; the only thing people said was â€œhow is the air up thereâ€. Some people get called ugly or whatever on daily basis.
There was one guy in high school who bullied me and told me if his kids were gay he'd throw them over a bridge and now he's dating a girl that I used to be really cool with n I wanna ask her if they had a gay kid if he would still kill it, like asking the real REAL questions
Tw: bullying Okay fluff tsukkiyama au where kei and tadashi have been dating for 5 years now. Tsukkishima isn't as affectionate as yamaguchi so there's some instances that yamaguchi gets insecure. Not only that, some of the students in his schools bullies him.
You seem really smart so Iâ€™m grateful for your valuable insight. Always happy to throw an ego boost to the bullies &amp; let em school me &amp; call me names. Hopefully it saves the poor ppl who have to deal w you in real life from some abuse
So... I'm 34 years old and I actually got bullied by a bunch of mean girls at a party. Mind blowing that people can still be that mean after leaving high school. Never partying in #Vancouver again.
I saw the kid that would bully me in middle school &amp; i swear to god i was about to fight him
I did think of bullying in schools and what bullies would do just to be spiteful
I got bullied by many people from 4th term grade 1 til the end of high school. When I became head girl of my school. I almost quit because of what they said. But I stuck it out and best choice I've made.
School bullies. Third-world dictators. Insatiable narcissism. The current #POTUS. ALL ARE THE SAME. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Do tall girls actually get bullied like this? The ones in my high school were all super popular and usually muscular af, so no one fucked with them
Your bullies at school might have thought the same.. "No harm intended" and just "for fun" Then why didn't you stay indifferent and why did you become stronger and resilient???
Nobody: The wall rn: BULLIES! THESE ARE HIGH SCHOOL FUCKING BULLIES #brickwallisoverparty
Always! I know what it was like to be bullied, from 5th grade into high school I was bullied by boys and girls and boys. Now as a grown woman it pisses me off seeing it in any form!
...hang around my friend while she normally had friends enough. This girl just wanted me away and insulted me all the time. But I never said anything about it because it was only one more year and I had been bullied the rest of high school. I was just fed up.
I went to PS. There are as many entitled, snobbish dickheads, bitchy girls and bullies as there are at any other school. There is snobbery and cliques in state schools. I was bullied in my private school and on the way home by kids from the local state high. 1/3
Why do all you trumpers act like middle school bullies? Such a strange phenomenon #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica
For boys: Did you refuse to go to school because of hyper toxic male bullies?
Getting ptsd from when I got bullied in high school from this one girl bc sheâ€™s been harassing my friend for no reason now
Oh and as for your violation of convention's your countries behaviour is like that if a school bully who liked to hand it out but runs and cries to mommy when they get some in return, take your propaganda Tokyo rose and stick were the sun doesn't shine
1995, at high school (Australia), when a black PNG friend was forced to remove her braids b/c a white girl copied them terribly. I had lived til then thinking wrongly that racism was only overt direct insults, which as a bullied and invisibly disabled kid I received as well.
It's been proven anytime a receives even the slightest bit of push back like any bully he backs down. Why are people who are suppose to be smarter than me so easily intimated by this middle school bully? Enabling him only makes things worse.
the girl you bullied in junior high school
Itâ€™s crazy cuz growing up I didnâ€™t like red girls , or the girls with long hair or all the pretty girls they all bullied me . Guys to . My entire time in elementary and middle school and some high school. But yâ€™all want girls like me to get over insecurities overnight
Tank Girl was a classic in my house. At least with my sister and I. I couldn't pull off the full look, but damn did it help inspire my makeup and nails for a chunk of high school.... Yes, I was bullied. Why do you ask?
Who's paying for private schools? They are not doing so hot themselves.( financially).
I had a very different high school experience. Thankfully. At my school, the culture of the school was very progressive. Matriculants would shame older boys trying to date younger girls, if you seemed lonely, people would invite you. If you bullied someone, you become an outcast.
.The bullies in prison are way worse than the bullies at school. This shooter made their bed and now they will lay in that cot.
ITS FUNNY HOW THEY TEACH YOU TO STAND UP TO BULLIES IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND NOW THE BULLIES ARE THE LIBERALS AT @EASPORTS @EAMaddenNFL

@typicaldumbasss I would definitely bully you if you were in my high school also GROW UP
She sounds like she was one of those mean girls who bullied other girls back in junior high, and now pretends she was all about dignity.
What will you do if you find out that your boyfriend's sister is the same girl that bullied you &amp; made life miserable in high school?
why is it that the girls who bullied me in high school all went to beauty school &amp; now Iâ€™m making appointments for them to do my hair.
You not the only one, a lot of women have to work ( very hard ) up to 3 jobs , weekends, holidays also. Take care children, parents, being harassed at work, bullied and we keep our head up high and going! Stop the tears little poor rich girl!!!!!!!
Once when I was in high shcool a girl who bullied me told me to just bring a gun and shoot up the school. I thought in that moment: You first. I then thought about raping her over the table like the Great Khan until she was fully educated. I didn`t. Ah, the small mercies.
yall r acting like yuta made friends w the elementary school bully and not a whole ass misogynistic anti korean little fuck . if youre not korean shut your goddamn mouth
I hope everyone has a great day today except for the girls (one of whom had been a huge fan too and went to a concert with me ) who bullied me heavily and made my life hell in high school for being in love with One Direction (except for one who has since apologized haha)
They won't stop their Hindu Hatred, we must start our Hindu Assertion everyone in school has a school bully, we only respected him out of fear, nothing else Hs must reach that level of fearfulness among others

The light skins that bullied darker girls in middle/ high school are upset. Now they screaming they got bullied too. Girl I know you remember high school. Pls shut up.
People who bullied others for being â€˜fatâ€™ in high school are really out here dating bigger girls 4 years later.
In high school there was a group of black girls that would defend me when I was being bullied. I appreciate them so much.
You look like someone who would bully me in my high school
Again. Thatâ€™s not leadership. Itâ€™s how to deal with a high school bully.
You're a bit of a dork, aren't you?
Never will forget when the entire world predicted we'd beat the Packers in the NFCCG and niners twitter found the two people who thought we'd lose and bullied them like attention-starved high school girls

@nightbarbie I was making a vid when this rude girl started changing the screen color I told her too stop kindly and she â€œnoâ€ then I said â€œbut I got here firstâ€ the she said â€œtoo badâ€ and stared changing it. I get bullied a lot in royale high (I know itâ€™s because im black)
a new girl has started in my work and im pretty sure she bullied me in high school lmao love my life
there was a group of girls that bullied me in high school for literally no reason, they just decided they hated me. got bullied online after HS by my exâ€™s new gf he cheated on me with while simultaneously being bullied by my bf at the timeâ€™s friend that had a crush on him.

Our school won't be ordering anything that supports transphobic and litigious bullies like Rowling.
the popular girl bully trope in teen movies is funny to me because in high school it was always BOYS who bullied me lmao girls were nice
I remember when these three girls bullied me on the bus in high school because of the boy I was dating... that was probably when I peaked now that I think about it.
and we're all white women who bullied people in high school only to dm those same people saying "Hey girl!"
So I really try my best to be mature.... Seriously, adulting at its finest over here.... But it brings me great satisfaction seeing all the girls that bullied me in high school BLEW TF UP. Lmao this â€œlesbian wrestlerâ€ is really out doin ya now.
I obviously donâ€™t know either of them, but from what Iâ€™ve seen, Keiraâ€™s been hurt like crazy in the past and puts on a hard persona, while Alisha is the girl in high school who laughed and mocked those who were bullied by the ring leader.
girls who bullied me in high school are gfs now and im watercolor paint
exposing my bullies. these are bullies. these are high school fucking bullies https://twitter.com/finefolklore/status/1288202853333569539
So many comments here resonate with my experience of PE at school. A bully of a teacher who only cared about the boys on the team, no instruction, being terrified of the changing room and a consistent â€˜Dâ€™ grade on my report (and the same comments) no matter what I did to improve.
I was the fat, glasses-wearing new girl every year of both Jr High &amp; High School. "Hell" doesn't even come close. This was late '70s-early '80s, before all this anti-bullying stuff started. If you talked to adults about being bullied, they told you to toughen up.
Murdoc scanned the two men. Both were pathetic, acting all tough like school yard bullies. He's dealt with more than a few of these. "I'll 'chill out' when you bugger off!" The bassists shoulders were up in increased rage. They did not want to take this further.urdocs anger--
in high school a girl didnâ€™t go to school for a week cause she said i bullied her... she said i was spitting gummy bears in her hair on the bus when i was called to the principals office i said â€œokay but if iâ€™m going through the effort of chewing gummy bears, imma swallow emâ€

WHAT THE FUCK I HATE FOOTBALL MAN U NIGGERS ARE DUMB
Probably one of the many times I declined white tears and doofy negro acceptability action. Or maybe when I called that black(he don't deserve the capital B) man something with a hard R. Truthfully it could be many things lol
Niggers are against colored people. Blacks will never root out racism. Why they do not know their nationality. You know a tree by it's fruit

He's not an ally to black people by any means. Any white man who proudly says "I'm a House nigger" is disingenuous and disgusting
I didn't get anything out of this interview that suggests trump's agenda would help the black and brown communities. It's the same talking points. It's always what was in the past. We are talking about now. #TrumpLiesAmericansDie

(Acts 29:22531) SINCE the white people DO NOT look the way God looks which is Divine Dark Skinned "Golden" Negro, NOT GOD COLORED PEOPLE by no means, but do "favor" the Devil which is White, see 2nd Corinthians 11:14, a "white" light demon from Hell, God called Satan, WHITE like
i feel like there was probably definitely a conversation like tbis between a â€œprogressiveâ€ white person and their negro friend sometime in the 50s/60s â€œi called HIM a nigge* but youâ€™re not like those nigge*s - i would never call you that franklin!â€

Jackasses, u can't alter history. U can learn from it and be far better ppl. The pt is not to idolize these statues but to remind white Americans that racism is divisive and colored Americans to stop blaming the past but work harder for the future.

In 2007, he referred to Obama, whose father was black and mother was white, as a "halfrican-American." Later that year, he called him "Barack the Magic Negro." And during the Obama administration, he said: "The white kids now get beat up with the black kids cheering."

9. Depends which one. Calling someone a â€œniggerâ€ is racist and disgusting and only appropriate in a context like â€œso-and-so said niggerâ€ Urban people use the word nigga all the time. Black people have called me their nigga. Those who think white ppl saying it is wrong are stupid

Seriosuly though, I dont get it how men like being looked apon in that way it's disgusting. The fact she's downgrading herself saying she's a "bbc slave". And the three other "black" dudes that were saying shes a "queen" and could call them a nigger. Like wtf
I'm a baseball history buff. There was a minor-league baseball team called the Atlanta Crackers (this was a white team). Eventually, the Negro league team, also located in Atlanta, took on the name of the white team. The Negro league team was called the Atlanta Black Crackers.
Just because the words "Black Lives Matter" are painted on the street outside Trump Tower doesn't mean Trump "will have to acknowledge" anything. Reading words doesn't necessarily equate to agreeing with their meaning. And, if you want racist, look up Barely There Biden's past.

Thank you, I become upset, I can see the outcome. It was LBJ's prized Great Society, however, it was a ploy to get Black people to vote for him. He was a wiley, disgusting man who literally stated, "We will have those Niggers' voting Democrat for rhe next 200 years! "
All the events that have been going on in the U.S. over the past week are heartbreaking, all people are human and just because you have different colored skin deosnt mean you should be treated any different, weâ€™re all human!!! And we should stand together against racism!!!

[CN: racism] There was an "incident" one year that led to a ton of meetings, but no one ever said exactly what it was. Rumor was, they asked some Black kids who were on campus for a tutoring thing to pose in the background of their pictures and pretend to pick cotton.

Her attitude is a common one these days - that anything other than total deference to black political preferences is racism. A reasonable person could look at the hash made by Democrat run cities in the past few months and decide life might not be better with them in power.

It's not Mashabas tweet that's the problem, it's the way blacks on twitter do their knee-jerk defence of any black man who does any violence to any white man. SA blacks' hatred of whites exceeds anything justifiable by the past. You can't argue with a fool. He has his own logic.

And barely anything you said there was true. I never said "racism is the only reason" for poor black people, very bold assumption. I understand it's complex, but I take into account how past actions shape current society, whereas you choose to ignore that, and blame black people.
Ur dumb as fuck for takin that lyin ass nigger back.
Remember that Xbox One X I just picked up? Yeah, it's broken already. Outputting a black screen and I can't get past it. I was using it about 2 hours a go playing Forza 7 and now it won't even show anything on the screen.
If anything, past actions from the FBI show that they want to maintain the status quo. From quashing the black panthers to infiltrating the Klan, theyâ€™re happy with the way things are. Why would they try to escalate racial tensions? Makes no sense.

I fully agree But lately, itâ€™s become justified to murder people just for using a dumb word. Nigger has become as ubiquitous, obsolete as â€œfuckâ€. Both promoted incessantly in the media. For decades. People use them I use nigger, or fuck, just to defend Freedom of Expression.
Some of them who aint black are fine people when they use the word nigger in the right context -exposing someone's disgusting racism, which he's obviously doing.

You twitter niggers are dumb as fuck.
I didn't know posting memes with the n word as a non black person was unacceptable. I now have seen that it is actually offensive and shouldn't be done. I'm sorry for doing this in the past and I'll make sure to never do it again in the future. If I do/say anything that happens
It's truly disgusting that "nigger" is the only racial slur people are supposedly not allowed to use. That basically means black people are somehow more important than the other minorities, or that the discrimination they've faced is somehow worse, neither of which is true.
Twitter do the stuff, this guy SMH he said nigger in danish. It disgust me that this guy even have the nerve to write it and post it on his snap. I took this pic and blocked him After, itâ€™s disgusting because he knows whatâ€™s going on rn. #BLACK_LIVES_MATTER
