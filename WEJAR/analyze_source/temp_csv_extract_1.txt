Today I voted for a pragmatic solution to end the government shutdown and avert a financial crisis by raising the debt ceiling This was a manufactured crisis created by extremists who refuse to acknowledge that Americans are sick and tired of partisan gridlock and political brinksmanship   It is critical now more than ever that Congress work together to avoid a future crisis that could derail our economic recovery jeopardize our countrys credit rating and put our most vulnerable citizens at risk  As we move forward Congress must put people above partisanship and solutions above ideology I stand ready to work with my colleagues in both political parties toward that end

Today I voted NO along with every House Democrat on the GOPRyan Budget which is a disastrous for our economy our families and the future of our country Imagine this  if the GOP budget actually became law it would result in  million lost jobs in  alone according to the Economic Policy Institute   Instead of common sense investments such as growing the economy creating jobs and strengthening our families this Republican budget is harmful  It lowers taxes on the wealthiest Americans while  of the nondefense budget cuts come from programs helping low or moderate income families  The GOP cuts and guts  trillion over the next decade from programs like Pell Grants for college students job training for dislocated workers nutrition programs for poor children and healthcare for our most vulnerable citizens   Congress needs to move forward with a balanced approach to address deficit reduction  increased revenues elimination of special interest tax breaks smart cuts to failing programs and investments in growing the economy

      Living with a disability is like being stuck in a neverending nightmare You're constantly reminded of your limitations and forced to confront your own inadequacies every single day It's like having a target on your back for everyone to see and judge you by Just try to imagine what it would be like to have your whole life defined by something you can't control something that makes you feel worthless and powerless all at once And the worst part is some people will still tell you that it's not so bad because they think you're just being overly sensitive Well it's my opinion that everyone deserves respect and dignity no matter what their abilities or disabilities are So if you ask me I'll call a disability a 'disability' and not sugarcoat it with any other word That's the truth as harsh as it may be

For the past few weeks I have been undecided but leaning against authorizing military strikes in Syria  I was willing to remain open until President Obama could make his case to the American people which he did from the East Room last night  After listening to the speech I have not been persuaded to support military action in Syria  Unfortunately the speech left unanswered questions about whether or not the administration has a specific plan for a limited military action that will advance broader strategic objectives  It also remains unclear what sorts of planning the administration is undertaking for various contingencies that might arise as a result of the strike  This is consistent with the lack of detail I have received in classified briefings with administration officials  At the very least clarity and more forthcoming responses on these issues is necessary before I would consider supporting military action  I hold out hope that recent diplomatic developments will bring about a peaceful resolution to the situation  But I also realize that a deal brokered by the Russians is unlikely to be on balance a very good deal and will remain difficult to implement  While we wait for the diplomatic track to play itself out the White House must engage Congress in a deeper and more open manner than they have thus far
